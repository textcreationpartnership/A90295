            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  </gap>e,</hi> since one Mr <hi>Biddle,</hi> (formerly a <hi>Master</hi> of <hi>Arts</hi> of this University, by which <hi>Title</hi> he still ownes himselfe) <hi>Published two Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Catechismes,</hi> (as he calls them) wherein under sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry <hi>specious</hi> Pleas and Pretences, (which you will find <hi>discussed</hi> in the ensuing Treatise) he endeavours to insinuate <hi>subtilly</hi> into the minds of <hi>unstable</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned men,</hi> the whole substance of the <hi>Socinian</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The man is a <hi>Person,</hi> whom (to my knowledge) I never <hi>saw,</hi> nor have been at all <hi>curious</hi> to enquire after the place of his habitation, or <hi>course</hi> of his Life. His opposition some years since, to the <hi>Deity of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost,</hi> and <hi>now</hi> to that of the <hi>Father and Sonne</hi> also, is all that he is <hi>known</hi> to me by. It is not with his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> that I have any <hi>contest:</hi> he <hi>stands</hi> or <hi>falls</hi> to his own Master. His Arguments against the Deity of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> were somewhile since answered by <hi>Clop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penburgh,</hi> then <hi>Professor</hi> of Divinity at <hi>Franeker</hi> in <hi>Friesland,</hi> since at <hi>rest</hi> in the Lord; and (as I have heard) by <hi>one</hi> in <hi>English.</hi> His <hi>Catechismes</hi> also are gone
<pb facs="tcp:115372:4"/> over the Seas, whereof <hi>farther</hi> mention must after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be made. At their first Publishing, complaint being given in by some <hi>worthy</hi> Persons to the <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Councell</hi> against them, as <hi>abusive</hi> to the <hi>Majesty</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the Word of God, and <hi>destructive</hi> to many important Truths of the Gospell, (which was done without any <hi>knowledge</hi> of mine) They were pleased to <hi>send for me,</hi> and to <hi>require</hi> of me the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of that Work, which is here <hi>presented</hi> unto you. Being <hi>surprized</hi> with their <hi>request,</hi> I laboured to excuse my selfe to the <hi>utmost,</hi> on the account of my <hi>many employments</hi> in the University and elsewhere, with other Reasons of the like <hi>nature,</hi> which to my thoughts did then <hi>occurre.</hi> Not prevailing with them, they <hi>persisting in their Command,</hi> I looked on it as a <hi>call</hi> from God to <hi>plead</hi> for his <hi>violated</hi> Truth, which by his <hi>Assistance,</hi> and according as I had <hi>Opportunity,</hi> I was in generall allway resolved to doe. Having <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed</hi> but newly taken off my <hi>hand</hi> from the <hi>Plough</hi> of a peculiar Controversy, about the <hi>Perseverance of the Saints,</hi> in the following whereof I was somewhat <hi>tired,</hi> the <hi>Entrance</hi> into the Work was <hi>irkesome</hi> and <hi>burthensome</hi> unto me: After some progresse made, finding the searching <hi>into,</hi> and discussing of the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truths</hi> opposed, of very good <hi>use</hi> to my <hi>selfe,</hi> I have been carried through the whole (according as I could break off my <hi>dayly pressing occasions</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend unto it) with much <hi>Cheerfulnesse,</hi> and Alacrity of mind. And this was the Reason, why, finding M. <hi>B.</hi> came short of giving a <hi>faire occasion</hi> to the <hi>full vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of many heads of Religion by him oppugned, I have called in to his <hi>Assistance</hi> and <hi>Society</hi> one of his great Masters, namely <hi>Valentinus Smalcius,</hi> and his <hi>Catechisme</hi> (commonly called the <hi>Racovian</hi>) with the

Now besides your <hi>Interest</hi> in the <hi>Truths</hi> pleaded for, there are other <hi>Considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> also, inducing me to a <hi>perswasion,</hi> that this endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of mine will not be unacceptable unto you▪ M. <hi>B's Catechisme</hi> (as I said) being carried <hi>over,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed in sundry places of the <hi>Ʋnited Provinces,</hi> the Professors of their <hi>Academies,</hi> (who have all general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Learned the <hi>English Tongue,</hi> to enable them for the Understanding of the <hi>Treatises of Divinity</hi> in all kinds writtē therein, which they begin to make use of, to <hi>the purpose</hi>) cry out against thē, &amp; <hi>professedly</hi> undertake the refutation thereof.

            <p>Certainly, though we <hi>deserved</hi> to have these <hi>reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> cast upon us, yet of all men in the World, <hi>those</hi> who live under the <hi>Protection,</hi> and upon the allowance of the <hi>Ʋnited Provinces,</hi> are most <hi>unmeet</hi> to mannage them: Their <hi>incompetency</hi> in sundry respects for this <hi>service</hi> is known to all.

That it is by Providence fallen upon the <hi>hand</hi> of one, more <hi>um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meet</hi> then <hi>many</hi> others in this place, for the <hi>perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> of this Work and <hi>Duty,</hi> I doubt not but you will be <hi>contented</hi> withall; and am <hi>bold</hi> to hope, that neither the <hi>Truth,</hi> nor your <hi>own esteeme,</hi> will too much <hi>suffer,</hi> by my engagement herein. Yea, give me leave to speak it, I have assumed the <hi>confidence,</hi> to aime at the <hi>handling</hi> of the whole <hi>Body of the Socinian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> in such a <hi>way</hi> and manner, as that those who are <hi>most knowing,</hi> and exercised in these <hi>Controversies,</hi> may find that, which they will not <hi>altogether despise,</hi> and <hi>younger</hi> Students that, whereby they may <hi>profit.</hi> To this End I have added the <hi>Racovian Catechisme,</hi> (as I said before) to M. <hi>B's:</hi> which as I was <hi>urged</hi> to doe by many worthy Persons in this <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> so I was no way <hi>discouraged</hi> in the publishing of my <hi>Answer</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, by the view <hi>I</hi> took of <hi>Arnoldus</hi> his discourse to the same purpose, and that for <hi>such Reasons,</hi> as <hi>I</hi> shall not expresse, but leave the whole to the judgement of the Reader.</p>
            <p>From <hi>thence,</hi> whence in the <hi>thoughts</hi> of <hi>Some, I</hi> am most <hi>likely</hi> to suffer, as to my own <hi>Resolves, I</hi> am most secure. It is in medling with <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>Annotations,</hi> and calling into <hi>question</hi> what hath been delivered by such a <hi>Gyant</hi> in al kinds of <hi>Literature.</hi> Since my <hi>engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in this Businesse, &amp; when I had well nigh finished the <hi>Vindication</hi> of the Texts of Scripture <hi>commonly</hi> pleaded, for the Demonstration of the <hi>Deity</hi> of Christ, from the Exceptions put into their <hi>Testimonies,</hi> by the <hi>Racovian Catechisme,</hi> I had the sight of Dr <hi>H's</hi> Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for him, in his Vindication of his <hi>Dissertations</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Episcopacy,</hi> from my occasionall <hi>Animadversions,</hi> published in the Preface of my Book of the <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115372:6"/> of the <hi>Saints.</hi> Of that whole <hi>Treatise</hi> I shall else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where give an account. My Defensative as to my dealing with <hi>Grotius</hi> his <hi>Annotations,</hi> is suited to what the <hi>Doctor</hi> pleads in his <hi>behalfe,</hi> which occasions this <hi>mention</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This very Pious, Learned, Judicious Man</hi> (he tells us) <hi>hath fallen under some harsh censures of late, especially upon the account of Socinianisme and Popery.</hi> That is, not as though he would <hi>Reconcile</hi> those <hi>Extreames,</hi> but being in <hi>Doctrinalls</hi> a <hi>Socinian,</hi> he yet closed in many things with the <hi>Roman</hi> interest: as I no way doubt, but Thousands of the same <hi>perswasion</hi> with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> as to the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Christ, do live in the outward Communion of that <hi>Church</hi> (as they call it) to this day; of which <hi>supposall I</hi> am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>considerable</hi> grounds, and eminent instances for its Confirmation. This (<hi>I</hi> say) is <hi>their</hi> charge upon him. For his being a <hi>Socinian</hi> (he tells us) <hi>Three things are made use of, to beget a jealousy in the minds of men of his inclinations that way. 1. Some parcells of a Letter of his to</hi> Crellius, 2. <hi>Some Relations of what passed from him at his Death. 3. Some passages in his Annotations.</hi> It is this Last alone wherein <hi>I</hi> am concerned. And what <hi>I</hi> have to speak to <hi>them, I</hi> desire may be <hi>measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> and Weighed by what <hi>I</hi> doe premise. It is not that <hi>I</hi> do entertaine in my <hi>selfe</hi> any hard thoughts, or that <hi>I</hi> would beget in others any evill <hi>surmises</hi> of the <hi>Eternall condition</hi> of that man, that <hi>I speake</hi> what <hi>I</hi> do. What <hi>am I, that I should judge another mans Servant?</hi> He is <hi>fallen</hi> to his own <hi>Master.</hi> I am very slow to judge of mens Acceptation with God, by the <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension</hi> of their Understanding. This only <hi>I</hi> know, that be <hi>men</hi> of what <hi>Religion</hi> soever, that is <hi>professed</hi> in the World, if they are <hi>Drunkards, Proud, Boasters, &amp;c.
<pb facs="tcp:115372:6"/> Hypocrites, haters of good men, persecutors and revilers of them,</hi> yea if they be not <hi>regenerate</hi> and <hi>borne of God,</hi> united to the head <hi>Christ Jesus,</hi> by the same <hi>spirit</hi> that is in him, they shall never see God.</p>
            <p>But for the Passages in his <hi>Annotations,</hi> the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the <hi>Doctors plea</hi> is; that the <hi>passages intimated</hi>

               <hi>are in his Posthuma, that he intended not to publish them, that they might be of things he observed, but thought far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to consider: and an instance is given in that of Col.</hi> 1. 16. which he interprets, contrary to what he urged it for, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1, 2, 3. But granting what is <hi>affirmed</hi> as to matter of <hi>fact,</hi> about his <hi>Collections;</hi> (though the Preface to the last part of his <hi>Annotations</hi> will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it to be true) I must needs abide in my dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction as to these <hi>Annotations,</hi> &amp; of my resolves in these <hi>Thoughts</hi> give the <hi>Doctor</hi> this account. Of the <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Religion there are <hi>two</hi> main Parts; the first is <hi>Photinianisme,</hi> the latter <hi>Pelagianisme:</hi> The first <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> the <hi>Person,</hi> the other the <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ. Let us take an Eminent instance out of either of these heads: out of the First, their denying <hi>Christ</hi> to be <hi>God by Nature.</hi> Out of the <hi>Latter,</hi> their <hi>denyall</hi> of his <hi>Satisfaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the First, <hi>I</hi> must needs tell the <hi>Apologist,</hi> that of all the Texts of the <hi>New</hi> Testament and <hi>Old,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the <hi>Deity</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> is usually Confirmed, and where it is evidently testified unto, He hath not left any more then <hi>one</hi> (that I have observed) if one, speaking any thing <hi>clearly</hi> to that purpose. <hi>I</hi> say, if <hi>one,</hi> for that he speaks not <hi>home</hi> to the businesse in <hi>hand</hi> on <hi>Joh. 1. I</hi> shall elsewhere give an Account; perhaps some <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> more may be <hi>interpreted</hi> according to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy</hi> of that. <hi>I</hi> speak not of his <hi>Annotations</hi> on the <hi>Epistles,</hi> but on the whole Bible <hi>throughout,</hi> whererein
<pb facs="tcp:115372:7"/> his <hi>Expositions</hi> given, do for the most part fall in with those of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> &amp; oftentimes <hi>consist</hi> in the very words of <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Smalcius,</hi> and alway do the <hi>same</hi> things with them, as to any <hi>notice</hi> of the <hi>Deity</hi> of Christ in them. So that <hi>I</hi> marvell the <hi>Learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> should <hi>fixe</hi> upon <hi>one particular</hi> instance, as though that <hi>one place</hi> alone were <hi>corrupted</hi> by him, when there is not <hi>one</hi> (or but <hi>one</hi>) that is not <hi>wrested, perverted,</hi> and <hi>corrupted</hi> to the same purpose. For the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the Truth hereof, I refer the Reader to the ensuing Considerations of his Interpretatiōs of the places themselves. The condition of these <hi>famous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations,</hi> as to the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ, is the same: not <hi>one</hi> Text of the <hi>whole Scripture,</hi> wherein <hi>Testimony</hi> is given to that <hi>sacred Truth,</hi> which is not Wrested to <hi>another</hi> sence, or at least the Doctrine <hi>in it</hi> concealed, and <hi>obscured</hi> by them. I do not speak this with the <hi>least</hi> intention to <hi>cast</hi> upon him the <hi>reproach</hi> of a <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian:</hi> I judge not his <hi>Person;</hi> his Books are Published to be considered and judged. <hi>Erasmus</hi> I know made way for him, in most of his <hi>Expositions</hi> about the Deity of Christ: but what <hi>repute</hi> he hath thereby <hi>obtained</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all that honour the <hi>Eternall Godhead</hi> of the Son of God, let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Beza</hi> on the other, evince. And as I will by no <hi>meanes</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or urge against <hi>Grotius</hi> any of the miscarriages in <hi>Religion,</hi> which the <hi>Answerer</hi> of my <hi>Animadversions</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to vindicate him from; nor do I <hi>desire</hi> to <hi>Fight</hi> with the <hi>dust</hi> and <hi>Ashes</hi> of men; yet what I have said, <hi>is,</hi> if not <hi>necessary</hi> to <hi>return</hi> to the <hi>Apologist,</hi> yet of tendency, I hope, to the Satisfaction of others, who may enquire after the Reason of my calling the <hi>Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of the Learned Man to an account in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. Shall any one take <hi>liberty</hi> to pluck down the
<pb facs="tcp:115372:7"/>
               <hi>Pillars</hi> of our Faith, and weaken the <hi>Grounds</hi> of our <hi>assurance,</hi> concerning the <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of our Lord Jesus Christ, and shall not we have the <hi>boldnesse</hi> to call him to an <hi>account</hi> for so <hi>sacrilegious</hi> an attempt; with those then, who <hi>Love</hi> the Lord Christ in <hi>sincerity, I</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no <hi>blame</hi> or <hi>reproach</hi> for what <hi>I</hi> have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this kind; yea that my <hi>good will</hi> shall find <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> with them, especially if it shall occasion any of <hi>greater leasure</hi> and Abilities farther, and professedly to remarke more of the <hi>Corruptions</hi> of those <hi>Annotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I</hi> have good ground of Expectation.

            <p>The Holy Ghost tels us, that <hi>we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himselfe being the chief corner stone, in whome the whole building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord, in whom we are built together for an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation of God through the spirit,</hi> Ephes. 2. 20, 21, 22.

That among other <hi>important</hi> Heads of the Gospel (as that of <hi>justification by faith,</hi> and not by <hi>works,</hi> of <hi>Christian Liberty,</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection</hi> of the dead,) this most Glorious Truth of the <hi>Eternal Deity of the Son of God,</hi> underwent an open Opposition from <hi>some</hi> of them above written, during <hi>the life</hi> of some of the Apostles, before the writing of the <hi>Gospel</hi> by <hi>John,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115372:12"/> and was expresly <hi>vindicated</hi> by <hi>him</hi> in the beginning thereof, is acknowledged by all, who have in any measure <hi>inquired into,</hi> and <hi>impartially weighed</hi> the Reports of those dayes.

Perhaps they <hi>think,</hi> that if he should now <hi>speak</hi> from heaven, they would <hi>believe</hi> him. So said the <hi>Jewes</hi> to Christ, if he would come down from the <hi>Cross</hi> when they had <hi>nayled</hi> him to it: In the sight, &amp; under the contempt of <hi>many miracles</hi> greater then the <hi>delivery</hi> of himselfe could any way appear to be. The <hi>rich man</hi> in <hi>torments</hi> thought his <hi>brethren</hi> would <hi>repent</hi> if one came from the dead, and preached to them. <hi>Abraham</hi> tels him, <hi>if they will not believe Moses nor the Prophets,</hi> they would not <hi>believe</hi> though one should come from they dead.

            <p>A <hi>designe</hi> he had in <hi>hand,</hi> that was like to doe him more <hi>service</hi> then any of his former <hi>attempts.</hi> Having therefore tryed his <hi>ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most</hi> in open <hi>opposition</hi> to the person of Christ, (The dreggs of the poyson thus shed abroad infecting in <hi>some measure</hi> a great part of the <hi>East</hi> to this day) by a way never before heard of, and which <hi>Christians</hi> were not exercised with, nor in any <hi>measure</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of, he subtilly <hi>ruines</hi> and overthrowes <hi>all his Offices,</hi> and the whole benefit of his <hi>mediation,</hi> and introduceth secretly a <hi>new Worship,</hi> from that which he <hi>appointed,</hi> by the Meanes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of men, pretending <hi>to Act,</hi> and doe all that they did, for the <hi>Advancement</hi> of his Kingdome and Glory. And therefore, whilest the <hi>fatal Apostacy</hi> of the <hi>westerne World,</hi> under the <hi>Roman Antichrist,</hi> was contriving, carrying on, and <hi>heightning,</hi> till it came to it's discovery and ruine, he stirs not at all with his old <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,</hi> which had brought in a <hi>revenue</hi> of <hi>obedience</hi> to his <hi>kingdome,</hi> in no measure <hi>proportionable</hi> to this, which by this <hi>new</hi> device he found accrewing to him. But when the <hi>appointed Time</hi> of <hi>mercy</hi> was come, that God would <hi>visit</hi> his people with light from above, and begin to <hi>unravel the mystery of Iniquity,</hi> whose Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons had destroyed the <hi>Soules</hi> of them that embraced it, and whose <hi>cruelty</hi> had cut off the <hi>lives</hi> of <hi>thousands</hi> who had <hi>opposed</hi> it, by the reformation eminently and successively <hi>begun</hi> and carryed on,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115372:13"/> from the year 1517; Sathan perceiving that even this his great <hi>master-piece</hi> of <hi>deceit</hi> and subtilty was like to <hi>faile</hi> him, and not to doe him that service, which <hi>formerly</hi> it had done, he <hi>againe</hi> sets on foot his first <hi>designe</hi> of oppugning the <hi>Eternal Deity</hi> of the Son of God; still remembring that the <hi>Ruine</hi> of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome arose from the <hi>God-head</hi> of his person, and the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of his Meditation. So that as for the <hi>first</hi> 300 yeares of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of the name of Christ in the world, he had <hi>variously</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the <hi>God-head</hi> of our blessed Saviour, by <hi>Simon Magus, Ebion, Cerinthus, Paulus Samosatenus, Marcus, Basilides, Valentinus, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lobarsus, Marcion, Photinus, Theodorus,</hi> and others, and from their dissipation and scattering, having gathered them <hi>all</hi> to an <hi>head</hi> in <hi>Arius</hi> and his Abomination; which sometimes with a <hi>mighty</hi> prevalency of <hi>force</hi> and <hi>violence,</hi> sometimes more <hi>subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (putting out by the way the several branches of <hi>Macedonia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme, Nestorianisme, Eutichianisme,</hi> all looking the same way in their tendency therewith) he managed almost for the space of the next 300 years ensuing, and loosing at length that hold, he had spent more then <hi>double</hi> that space of time, in carrying on his designe of the great Antichristian <hi>Papal</hi> Apostacy, being about the <hi>times</hi> before mentioned most cleerly and eminently discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his <hi>wicked designe,</hi> and being in <hi>danger</hi> to loose his <hi>kingdome,</hi> which he had been so long in <hi>possession</hi> of; intending if it were <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi> to retrive his <hi>Advantage</hi> againe; He sets on those men, who had been <hi>instrumental</hi> to reduce the Christian Religion into it's primitive state and Condition, with <hi>those</hi> very <hi>Errours</hi> and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations, wherewith he opposed and assailed the <hi>Primitive Professours</hi> thereof. If they will have the <hi>Apostles doctrine,</hi> they shall have the opposition that was made unto it in the <hi>Apostles times:</hi> His hopes being possibly the same, that formerly they were; but <hi>assuredly</hi> Christ will prevent him. For as whilest the <hi>Professors</hi> of the Religion of Jesus Christ were <hi>spiritual</hi> &amp; full of the power of that <hi>Religion</hi> they did profess, they defended the Truth thereof, either by suffering, as under <hi>Constantius, Valens,</hi> and the <hi>Gothes</hi> &amp; <hi>Vandals;</hi> or by <hi>spiritual</hi> meanes and weapons; so when they were <hi>carnal,</hi> and lost the life of the Gospel, yet endeavouring to <hi>retaine</hi> the truth of the letter thereof, falling on <hi>carnal politick</hi> wayes for the <hi>supportment</hi> of it, and the <hi>suppressing</hi> of what opposed it, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan

            <p>1.

            <p>From these his <hi>pretence</hi> of abstaining, was, their <hi>rigid injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of all to be <hi>rebaptized,</hi> that entered into their fellowship, and communion.

Wherefore he fals upon an <hi>opinion</hi> much <hi>better</hi> suited to his <hi>designe,</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that <hi>baptisme</hi> was only <hi>instituted</hi> for the <hi>initiation of them,</hi> who from <hi>any other false</hi> Religion were turned to the <hi>Religion</hi> of Christ; but that it <hi>belonged</hi> not to <hi>Christian Societies,</hi> or to <hi>them</hi> that were <hi>borne of Christian parents,</hi> and had never been of any other <hi>profession</hi> or Religion, though they <hi>might</hi> use it, if they plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, as an <hi>indifferent</hi> thing.

I know that <hi>Generation</hi> of men retort upon <hi>us,</hi> the death of <hi>Servetus</hi> at <hi>Geneva;</hi> but the case was far different. <hi>Schlictingius</hi> lived in his <hi>owne</hi> country and <hi>convers'd</hi> with men of his owne <hi>persuasion,</hi> who in a <hi>succession</hi> had been so, before he was <hi>borne.

Servetus stufft</hi> all his discouses with <hi>horrid blasphemies.

If, faith he, Christ be the sonne of God, <hi>debuissent ergo dicere, quod Deus habebat uxorem quandam spiritualem, vel quod solus ipse masculosfaemineus aut Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphroditus, simul erat pater &amp; mater, nam ratio vocabuli non pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, ut quis dicatur sine matre pater: and; si</hi> logos <hi>filius erat, natus ex patre sine matre; dic mihi quomodo peperit eum, per ventrem an per latus.</hi>

            <p>To this height of <hi>Atheisme</hi> and <hi>blasphemy</hi> had <hi>Sathan</hi> wrought up the <hi>spirit</hi> of the man. So that I must say, he is the <hi>only person</hi> in the world, that I ever <hi>read</hi> or <hi>heard</hi> of, that ever died upon the account of Religion, in <hi>reference</hi> to whom the <hi>zeale</hi> of them that put him to death may be <hi>acquitted.</hi> But of these things, God will judge: <hi>Socinus</hi> saies he died <hi>calling on Christ;</hi> those that were <hi>present</hi> say, the quite contrary; and that in horrour he roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out <hi>misericordia</hi> to the magistrates, but nothing else: But <hi>Arcana Deo.</hi>

            <p>Not to speak of the <hi>General</hi> and more <hi>remote</hi> causes of <hi>these</hi> and and all other <hi>soul destroying Errours,</hi> or the <hi>darknesse, pride, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> and <hi>wilfulnesse</hi> of men, the <hi>craft, subtilty, envy,</hi> and <hi>malice</hi> of Sathan, the <hi>just revenging hand</hi> of God, giving men <hi>up to a spirit
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:115372:32"/> of delusion,</hi> that they might <hi>believe lyes,</hi> because they <hi>delighted not in the Truth,</hi> I shall only <hi>remarke</hi> one <hi>considerable occasion,</hi> or <hi>stumbling</hi> block at which they fell, and drank in the <hi>poyson,</hi> and one considerable <hi>Advantage</hi> that they had for the <hi>propagation</hi> of what they had so fallen into.</p>
            <p>Their great <hi>stumbling</hi> block I look upon to be the <hi>horrible cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> &amp; abuse of the <hi>doctrine of the Trinity</hi> in the <hi>writings</hi> of the <hi>Schoolmen,</hi> and the practise of the <hi>devotionists</hi> among the <hi>Papists.</hi> With what <hi>desperate</hi> boldness, <hi>Atheistical</hi> curiosity, wretched <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,</hi> and <hi>babling,</hi> the <hi>School men</hi> have <hi>polluted</hi> the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and gone off from the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Gospel in this great <hi>mystery,</hi> is so <hi>notoriously</hi> known, that I shall not need to <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble you</hi> with instances for the confirmation of the Observation. This, the men spoken of, (being the <hi>most,</hi> if not <hi>all</hi> of them brought up in the <hi>Papacy</hi>) stumbled at. They saw the doctrine concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>that God</hi> whom they were to <hi>worship</hi> rendered <hi>unintelligible, curious, intricate,</hi> involved in <hi>termes</hi> and <hi>expressions,</hi> not only <hi>barbarous</hi> in themselves, and not used in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> but <hi>insigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant, Horrid,</hi> and remote from the <hi>Reason</hi> of men; which after some <hi>strugling</hi> set them at <hi>liberty</hi> from under the <hi>bondage</hi> of those <hi>notions;</hi> And when they should have gone to the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> for their information, <hi>Sathan</hi> turned them <hi>aside</hi> to their own <hi>Reasonings,</hi> and <hi>Imaginations,</hi> where they <hi>stumbled</hi> and <hi>fell.</hi> And yet of the <hi>formes</hi> and expressions of their <hi>School-men</hi> are the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> soe Zealous, as that whoever departs from them in any <hi>Kind</hi> is presently an <hi>Antitrinitarian</hi> Heriticke. The dealings of <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine, Genebrard, Possevine</hi> and others, with <hi>Calvin,</hi> are known: One instance may be taken of their ingenuity. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his book <hi>de Christo,</hi> layes it to the charge of <hi>Bullinger,</hi> that in his book <hi>de Scripturae &amp; Ecclesiae authoritate,</hi> he wrote, that there were <hi>three Persons in the Deity, non statu, sed gradu, non subsistentiâ, sed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mâ, non potestate sed specie differentes;</hi> on which he <hi>exclaimes,</hi> that the <hi>Arians</hi> themselves never spake more <hi>wickedly:</hi> and yet these are the very words of <hi>Tertullian</hi> against <hi>Praxeas,</hi> which I confess are warily to be <hi>interpreted.</hi> But by this their <hi>measuring</hi> of Truth by the <hi>Formes</hi> received by <hi>Tradition</hi> from their <hi>fathers,</hi> neglecting and <hi>forsaking</hi> the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Gospel, that many stumbled and fell is most evident:</p>

This man</hi> (fayes he) <hi>in a letter from Constantinople to Doctour Gerlachius, tells him, that none turned Arians but those that were Calvinists first: and therefore he that would take heed of Arianisme, had best beware of Calvinisme.</hi> I am very unwilling to call any man's <hi>credit</hi> into question, who relates a matter of <hi>fact,</hi> unlesse undeniable <hi>Evidence</hi> enforce me, because it cannot be <hi>done</hi> without an <hi>imputation</hi> of the <hi>foulest</hi> crime: I shall therefore but take leave to aske</p>
            <p n="1">1. What <hi>Credit</hi> is to be given to the Testimony of this man who upon <hi>Conradus</hi> his owne report, was <hi>circumcised, turned Mahume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> and had wholly <hi>renounced</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> which he once professed. For my <hi>part,</hi> I should expect from such a <hi>person,</hi> nothing but what was <hi>maliciously</hi> contriv'd for the <hi>prejudice</hi> of the truth; &amp; therefore suppose he might raise this on <hi>purpose,</hi> to strengthen and harden the <hi>Lutherans</hi> against the <hi>Calvinists</hi> whom he hated most, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that they professed the truth which he had <hi>renounced,</hi> and that <hi>true knowledge</hi> of Christ and his will, which now he hated: and this <hi>lye</hi> of his, he looked on as an expedient for the <hi>hardening</hi> of the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in their Errour, and helping them with <hi>a stone</hi> to cast at the <hi>Calvinists.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Out of what <hi>kindesse</hi> was it that man bare to <hi>Gerlachius,</hi> and his <hi>companions,</hi> that he gives them this <hi>courteous</hi> Admonition to beware of <hi>Calvinisme.</hi> Is it any honour to <hi>Gerlachius, Conradus</hi> himselfe, or any other <hi>Lutheran,</hi> that an Apostate, an abjurer of <hi>Christian Religion loved</hi> them better then he did the <hi>Calvinists?</hi> what person this <hi>Adam Neuserus was,</hi> and what the end of him was, we have an account given by <hi>Maresius</hi> from a manuscript Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of <hi>Altingius.</hi> From <hi>Heidleberge,</hi> being suspected of a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy</hi> with one <hi>Sylvanus,</hi> who for it was put to death, he fled into <hi>Poland,</hi> thence to <hi>Constantinople;</hi> where he turned <hi>Mahumetan</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:115372:33"/> and was <hi>circumcised;</hi> and after a while fell into <hi>such miserable horror</hi> and despaire, that with <hi>dreadful yellings</hi> and <hi>clamours,</hi> he dyed; so that the <hi>Turkes</hi> themselves confess, that they never heard of a more horrid, <hi>detestable,</hi> and <hi>tragical</hi> end of any man; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they commonly called him, <hi>Satan Ogli,</hi> or the son of the <hi>Divel:</hi> and so much good may it doe <hi>Conradus,</hi> which his witnesse.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But what Occasion I pray does <hi>Calvinisme</hi> give to <hi>Arianisme,</hi> that the One should be taken <hi>heed</hi> of, if we intend to <hi>avoid</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: What <hi>offence</hi> doth it give to men enquiring after the <hi>Truth</hi> to make them stumble on their Abominations? What <hi>Doctrine</hi> doth it maintaine that should <hi>prepare</hi> them for it? but no man is <hi>bound</hi> to burden <hi>himselfe</hi> with more then he can <hi>carry,</hi> &amp; therefore all such enquiries <hi>Schlusselburgius</hi> took no notice of.</p>
            <p>The truth is, many of the <hi>persons</hi> usually instanced in, as <hi>Apostates</hi> from <hi>Calvinisme</hi> to <hi>Arianisme,</hi> were such, as leaving <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts of the <hi>Popes Dominion,</hi> came to shelter themselves, where they expected <hi>liberty,</hi> and <hi>opportunity</hi> of venting their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination among the reformed Churches, and joyned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with <hi>them</hi> in <hi>outward</hi> profession: most of <hi>them</hi> as afterwards appeared, being <hi>throughly infected</hi> with the <hi>errours</hi> against the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and about the <hi>Godhead,</hi> before they left the <hi>Papacy</hi> where they stumbled and fell.</p>
            <p>2. In the <hi>practise</hi> of the Church (as it is called) wherein they were <hi>bred,</hi> they nextly <hi>saw</hi> the <hi>horrible Idolatry</hi> that <hi>was</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced in abominable <hi>Pictures</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>worship</hi> yeelded to them, which strengthened and fortified their <hi>minds</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst such gross <hi>Conceptions</hi> of the <hi>nature of God,</hi> as by those <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures</hi> were exhibited.</p>
            <p>Hence when they had left the <hi>Papacy,</hi> and set up their <hi>opposition</hi> to the <hi>Blessed Trinity,</hi> in all their bookes they still <hi>made</hi> mention of those <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Pictures,</hi> speaking of them as the <hi>God of those that worshipped</hi> the Trinity; this instance <hi>makes</hi> up a good part of their book <hi>de fall â &amp; verâ cognitione unius Dei, Patris, Filii, &amp; Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritûs Sancti,</hi> written in the name of the Ministers of the <hi>Churches in Sarmatia,</hi> and <hi>Transilvania:</hi> book full of <hi>reproach</hi> and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: but this I say was annother occasion of <hi>stumbling</hi> to those miserable Wretches: they knew that thoughts the men of their <hi>communication</hi> had <hi>of God,</hi> by the <hi>Pictures</hi> made of him, and the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:115372:33"/> worship they yielded to them. They knew, how abhorrent to the <hi>very principles of Reason</hi> it was, that God should be such, as by them represented; and therefore set themselves at liberty (or rather gave up <hi>themselves</hi> to the service of <hi>Sathan</hi>) to find out <hi>another God</hi> whom they might worship.</p>
            <p>Neither are they a little <hi>confirmed</hi> to this day in their <hi>errours</hi> by sundry <hi>principles,</hi> which under the <hi>Roman Apostacy</hi> got <hi>footing</hi> in the <hi>minds</hi> of men professing the name of Jesus Christ: particularly they sheltered themselves from the sword of the <hi>word</hi> of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videncing the <hi>Deity</hi> of Christ, by <hi>Ascribing</hi> to him <hi>divine Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> by the <hi>sheild</hi> of the <hi>Papists doctrine,</hi> that those who are not God by nature may be <hi>adored, worshipped,</hi> and <hi>invocated.</hi>
            </p>

And therefore it is no <hi>wonder,</hi> if among so many (I may say) <hi>milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> of Persons, as in those dayes there were, that fell off from the <hi>Papacy,</hi> some <hi>thousands</hi> perhaps (much more <hi>Scores</hi>) might in their <hi>Enquirings,</hi> from an extreme of <hi>superstition,</hi> run into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of almost <hi>Atheisme.</hi> Such was the estate of <hi>things</hi> and <hi>men</hi> in those <hi>dayes,</hi> wherein <hi>Socianianisme,</hi> or the <hi>opposition</hi> to Christ of this <hi>latter</hi> edition, set <hi>forth</hi> in the world; Among the <hi>many</hi> that were <hi>convinced</hi> of the <hi>Abominations</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> before they were well <hi>fixed</hi> in the <hi>Truth,</hi> some were <hi>deceived</hi> by the <hi>cunning sleight</hi> of some <hi>few men,</hi> that lay in waite to deceive.

            <p n="1">1 At the first <hi>entrance</hi> upon their undertaking, some of <hi>them</hi> made no small <hi>Advantage</hi> in dealing with <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>unwary men,</hi> by <hi>crying out,</hi> that the termes of <hi>Trinity, Person, Essence, Hyposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical union, Communication</hi> of <hi>properties,</hi> and the like, were not found in the Scripture, and therefore were to be abandoned.</p>

            </head>
            <p>I Have often wondered and complained that there was no Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chism yet extant, (that I could ever see, or hear of) from whence one might learne the true grounds of the Christian Religion, as the same is delivered in the Holy Scripture, all Catechisms generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so stuffed with the supposals and traditions of men, that the least part of them is derived from the Word of God. For when Councells, Convocations and Assemblies of <hi>Divines,</hi> just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the sacred writers out of their place in the Church, had once framed Articles and Confessions of Faith, according to their own fancies and interests, and the Civil Magistrate had by his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ratified the same, all Catechisms were afterwards sitted to those Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and Confessions, &amp; the Scripture either wholly omitted, or brought in only for a shew, not one quotation amongst many being a whit to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as will soone appeare to any man of judgment, who taking into his hand the said Catechismes, shall examine the texts alledged in them: for if he do this diligently and impartially, he will find the Scripture, and those Catechismes to be at so wide a distance one from another, that he will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to question whether the Catechists gave any heed at all to what they wrote, and did not onely themselves refuse to make use of their Reason, but presume that their Readers also would do the same. In how miserable a condition then (as to spirituall things) must Christians generally needs be, when thus trained up, not, (as the Apostle adviseth) <hi>in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,</hi> but in the supposalls and traditions of men, having little or no assurance touching the reallity of their Religion! Which some observing, and not having the happinesse to light upon the Truth, have quite abandoned all Piety whatsoever, thinking there is no firme ground whereon to build the same. To prevent which mischiefe in time to come, by bringing men to a certainety, (I mean such men as owne the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Authority of the Scripture) and withall to satisfie the just and pious desires of many, who would faine understand the truth of our Religion, to the end they might not only be built up themselves, but also instruct their Children and Families in the same, I have here (according to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing I have gotten by continuall meditation on the Word of God) compiled a Scripture Catechism, wherein I bring the Reader to a sure and certain knowledg of the chiefest things pertaining both to belief and practice, whilest I my selfe assert nothing (as others have done before me) but only introduce the Scripture faithfully ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering its owne assertions, which all Christians confesse to be of undoubted truth. Take heed therefore whosoever thou art that lightest on this Booke, and there readest things quite contrary to the doctrines
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:115372:42"/> that passe currant amongst the generality of Christians, (for I confesse most of the things here displayed, have such a tendency) that thou fall not soul upon them, for thou canst not do so withot falling foul upon the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture it selfe, inasmuch as all the Answers through out the whole Catechism are faithfully transcribed out of it, and rightly applied to the Questions, as thou thyselfe mayst perceive if thou make a diligent inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction into the severall texts withall their circumstances. Thou wilt perhaps here reply, that the texts which I have cited: do indeed in the letter hold forth such things as are contrary to the doctrines commonly received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Christians, but they ought to have a mysticall or figurative inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation put upon them, and then both the Doctrines and the texts of Scripture will suit well enough. To which <hi>I</hi> answer, that if we once take this liberty to impose our mysticall or figurative interpretations on the Scripture, without expresse warrant of the Scripture it selfe, we shall have no setled beliefe, but be liable continually to be turned aside by any one that can invent a new mysticall meaning of the Scripture, there being no certaine rule to judge of such meanings, as there is of the literall ones: nor is there any error, how absurd &amp; impious soever, but may on such termes be accorded with the Scripture. All the abominable Idolatries of the Papists, all the superstitious Fopperies of the Turkes, all the licentious Opinions &amp; practices of the Ranters, may by this means be not only paliated, but defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Word of God. Certainly might we of our own heads figuratively interpret the Scripture, when the letter is neither repugnāt to oursenses, nor to the scope of the respective texts, nor to a greater number of plain texts to the contrary (for in such cases we must of necessity admit figurs in the sacred Volume, as wel as we do in prosane ons otherwise both they &amp; it will clash with themselves, or with our senses which the Scripture it selfe intimates to be of infallible certainty, see 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 2, 3.) might we I say at our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure impose our Figures and Allegories on the plain words of God, the Scripture would in very deed be, what some blasphemously affirm it to be <hi>a Nose of Wax.</hi> For instance, it is frequently asserted in the Scripture, that God hath a similitude or shape, hath his place in the Heavens, hath also affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions or passions, as love, hatred, mercy, anger, and the like, neither is any thing to the contrary delivered there, unlesse seemingly in certaine places which neither for number, nor clearenesse are comparable unto those of the other side. Why now should I depart from the letter of the Scripture in these particulars, and boldly affirme with the generality of Christians, (or rather, with the generality of such Christians ouly, as being conversant with the false Philosophy that reigneth in the Schools, have their understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings perverted with wrong notions) that God is without a shape, in no certain place, and uncapable of affections? Would not this be to u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Scripture like a Nose of Wax, and when of it selfe it looketh any way, to turne it aside at our pleasure? And would not God be so farre from spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to our capacity in his Word, (which is the usuall Refuge of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries, when in these and the like matters concerning God, they are pressed with the plain words of the Scripture) as that he would by so doing render us altogether uncapable of finding out his meaning, whilst he spake one thing, and understood the cleane contrary? Yea would he not have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115372:42"/> taken the direct course to make men substitute an Idol in his stead, (for the Adversaries hold, that to conceive of God as having a shape, or affections or being in a certaine place, is Idolatry) if he described himselfe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture otherwise then indeed he is, without telling us so much in plaine termes, that we might not conceive amisse of him? Thus we see, that when sleep, which plainely argueth weakenesse and imperfection, had been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to God <hi>Psal.</hi> 44. 23. The contrary is sayd of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 121. 4. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine when wearinesse had been attributed to him, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1. 14. The same is expressly denyed of him <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 28. And would not God (thinke ye) have done the like in those forementioned things, were the case the same in them, as in the others? This consideration is so pressing, that a certaine. Author, (otherwise a very learned and intelligent man) perceiving the weight thereof, and not knowing how to avoid the same, tooke up (though very unluckily) one erroneous tenet to maintaine another, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us in a late booke of his intituled <hi>Conjectura Cabalistica, that for Moses, by occasion of his writings, to let the Jewes entertaine a conceite of God us in humane shape, was not any more a way to bring them into Idolatry, then by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging man to be God, as</hi> (saith he) <hi>our Religion does in Christ.</hi> How can this consist even with consonancy to his own Principles, whilst he holds it to be false that God hath any shape, but true that Christ is God? For will a false opinion of God no sooner lead men into Idolatry, then a true opinion of Christ? But it is no marvell: that this Author, &amp; other learned men with him, entertaine such conceits of God and Christ, as are repugnant to the currēt of the Scripture, whilst they set so high a rate on the sublime indeed but uncertain notions of the Platonists, &amp; in the mean time slight the plain but certain letter of the Sacred Writers, as being far below the Divine Majesty &amp; written only to cōply with the rude apprehensions of the vulgar, unles by a mystical Interpretation they be scrued up to Platonism. This is the stone at which the Pride of learned men hath caused them continually to stumble, namely to think that they can speak more wisely &amp; worthily of God, then he hath spoken of himselfe in his word. This hath brought that more then Babylonish confusion of language into the Christian Religion, whilst men have framed those horrid and intricate expressions, under the colour of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting and excluding Heresies, but in truth to put a baffle on the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Scripture, and usher in Heresies, that so they might the more easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carry on their worldly designes, which could not be effected but through the ignorance of the people nor the people brought into ignorance, but by wrapping up Religiō in such mostrous termes, as neither the people nor they themselves that invented them, (or at least tooke them from the invention of others) did understand. Wherefore there is no possibility to reduce the Christian Religion to its primitive integrity, a thing, though much pretended yea bosted of in Reformed Churches, yet never hitherto sincerely endeavoured much lesse effected, in that men have by severe penalties been hindered to reforme Religion beyond such a stint, as that of <hi>Luther,</hi> cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For I have long since obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, (and finde my observation to be true and certaine) that when to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115372:43"/> matters of Religion men make use of words and Phrases unheard of in the Scripture, they slily under them couch false doctrines, and obtrude them on us: for without question the Doctrines of the Scripture can be so aptly explained in no language as that of the Scripture it selfe. Examine therefore the expressions <hi>of Gods being insinite and incomprehensible, of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a simple Act, of his subsisting in three persons, or after a threefold manner, of a Divine Circumincession, of an Eternall Generation, of an Eternall Procession, of an Incarnation, of an Hypostaticall Ʋnion, of a Communication of Properties, of the Mother of God, of God dying, of God made man, of Transubstantiation, of Consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, of Originall sinne, of Christs taking our nature on him, of Christs making satisfaction to God for our sinnes, both past, present and to come, of Christs fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Law for us, of Christs being punished by God for us, of Christs merits, or his meritorious obedience both active &amp; passive, of Christs purchasing the kingdom of Heaven for us, of Christs enduring the wrath of God, yea the paines of a damned man, of Christs rising from the dead by his own power, of the Ʋbiquity of Christs Body, of apprehending and applying Christs Righteousnesse to our selve; by Faith, of Christs being our Surety, of Christs paying our debts, of our sinnes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to Christ, of Christs righteousnesse imputed to us, of Christs dying to appease the wrath of God, and reconcile him to us of infused Grace, of free Grace, of the world of the Elect, of irresistible workings of the Spirit in bringing men to believe, of carnall reason, &amp; Spirituall desertions, of Spirituall incomes, of the Outgoings of God, of taking up the Ordinance, &amp;c.</hi> And thou shalt find, that as these formes of speech are not owned by the Scripture, so neither the things contained in them. How excellent therefore was that advice of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> in his second Epistle to him, chap. 1. 13. <hi>Hold fast the forme of sound words which thou hast heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus?</hi> For if we once let go those formes of sound words learned from the Apostles, and take up such as have been coined by others in succeeding Ages, we shall together part with the Apostles Doctrine, as wofull experience hath taught us. For after <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> and once deviated from the language of the Scripture, in the businesse touching the Sonne of God, calling him <hi>coessen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall</hi> with the Father, this opened a gap for others afterwards, under a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of guarding the Truth from Hereticks, to devise new termes at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which did by degrees so vitiate the chastity and simplicity of our Faith delivered in the Scripture, that there hardly remained so much as one point thereof sound &amp; entire. So that as it was wont to be disputed in the Schooles, whether the old ship of <hi>Thesus</hi> (which had in a manner been wholly altered at sundry times by the accession of new pieces of timber upon the decay of the old) were the same ship it had been at first, and not rather another by degrees substituted in the stead thereof: in like manner there was so much of the primitive truth worne away by the corruption that did by little and little overspread the generallity of Christians, and so many errors in stead thereof tacked to our Religion at severall times, that one might justly question whether it were the same Religion with that which Christ and his Apostles taught, and not another since devised by men, and put in the roome thereof. But thanks be to God through our Lord Jesus Christ, who amidst the universall corruption of our Religion, hath preserved his written word entire; (for had men corrupted it, they
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115372:43"/> would have made it speake more favourably in behalfe of their lusts and worldly interests, then it doth) which word if we with diligence &amp; sincerity pry into, resolving to embrace the doctrine that is there plainely delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though all the world should set it selfe against us for so doing, we shall easily discerne the Truth, and so be enabled to reduce our Religion to its first principles. For thus much I perceive by mine owne experience, who being otherwise of no great abilityes, yet setting my selfe with the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said resolution for sundry yeers together upon an impartiall search of the Scripture, have not only detected many errours, but here presented the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with a body of Religion, exactly transcribed out of the word of God; which body whosoever shall well ruminate and digest in his mind, may by the same method, wherein I have gon before him, make a farther enquiry into the Oracles of God, and draw forth whatsoever yet lyes hid, and being brought to light will tend to the accomplishment of Godlinesse amongst us, for at this only all the Scripture aimeth: the Script, which al men, who have thorowly studyed the same, must of necessity be enamored with as breathing out the meere wisdome of God &amp; being the exactest Rule of a holy life, (which all Religions whatsoever confesse to be the way unto Happinesse) that can be imagined, and whose Divinity will never even to the worlds end be questioned by any, but such as are unwilling to deny their worldly lusts, and obey the pure and pefect precepts thereof. Which obedience whosoever shall performe, he shall not only in the life to come, but even in this life be equall unto Angels.</p>

            <p>Whether we have Reason to stand to this determination, and acquiesce in this Censure and sentence, the ensuing confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, of what Mr <hi>B.</hi> substitutes in the Roome of those Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chismes which he here rejects, will evince &amp; manifest. But to give Countenance to this humble entrance into his worke, he tells his Reader, <hi>that Councells, Convocations, and Assemblyes of Divines have justled out the Scripture, and framed Confessions of Faith according to their owne fancyes and Interests, getting them confirmed by the Civill Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate; according unto which Confessions, all Catechismes are and have been framed without any regard to the Scripture;</hi> What Councells Mr <hi>Biddle</hi> intends, he informes us not, nor what it is that in them he chiefly complains of; If he intend some only, such as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statizing times of the Church saw, he knowes he is not oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them with whom he hath do; nor yet if he charge them

            <p>If all, as that of the Apostles themselves (<hi>Act.</hi> 15.) together with the rest that for some ages followed after, (and that as to the doctrine by them delivered) fall under his censure, we have nothing but the Testimony of M. <hi>B.</hi> to induce us to a beliefe of this insinuation; <note n="b" place="margin">

            <p>What I have to offer on this account, I have spoken other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. That the Confessions of Faith which the first <hi>Generall Councells</hi> (as they are called) during the space of 400 years and upward, Composed and put forth, were framed according to the <hi>fancies</hi> and <hi>interests</hi> of men, <hi>besides the word,</hi> is M. <hi>B's</hi> fancy, and his <hi>Interest</hi> to have it so esteemed. The <hi>Faith</hi> he profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or rather the <hi>Infidelity</hi> he is fallen into, was condemned in them all, and that upon the occasion of its then first coming into the World: <hi>Hinc illae Lachrimae:</hi> If they stand, he must fall; That <hi>the Catechismes of latter daies,</hi> (I suppose he intends those in use amongst the reformed Churches) <hi>did wholly omit the Scripture, or brought it in only for a shew, not one quotation amongst many being a whit to the purpose,</hi> you have the same <note n="c" place="margin">Calunmidre fortiter; ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid adhaere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit.</note> Testimony for, as for the Assertions foregoing.

The teaching part of his Catechisme being solely in the insinuating, ensnaring captious Questions
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115372:45"/> thereof, leading the understanding of the Reader, to a misapre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension and misaplication of the words of the Scripture (it being very easy to make up the grossest blasphemy Imaginable out of the words of the Scripture it selfe) I never found, saw, read, or head of any, so grossly perverting the Doctrine of the Scripture, concerning God, and all his wayes, as these of Mr <hi>B.</hi> doe: (for in sundry particulars, they exceed those mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of <hi>Socinus, Smalcius, Schlictingius,</hi> which had justly gotten the repute of the worst in the world;) &amp; for an account of my Reason of this perswasion, I referre the Reader, to the ensuing Considerations of them.</p>
            <p>This then being the sad estate of Christians, so misinformed by such vile <hi>Varlets,</hi> as have so fouly deceived them, and misled them, as above mentioned, what is to be don, and what course to be taken, to bring in light into the world, and to deliver men from the sorrowfull condition, whereinto they have been Catechised? For this end he tells the Reader, doth <note n="e" place="margin">Multa passun ab ultimâ ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tustate vitia admissa sunt, quae nemo pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter me indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabit. <hi>Scalig.</hi>

               </gap>) to unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them, and to bring them outof all their <hi>wanderings unto some certainty of Religion.</hi> This he discourses <hi>pag.</hi> 4, 5. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons he gives you of this undertaking are two, 1. <hi>to bring men to a certainty. 2. To satisfie the pious desires of some, who would faine know the truth of our Religion.</hi> The way he fixes on, for the compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the end proposed, is 1. <hi>By asserting nothing, 2. By introducing the plaine texts of Scripture to speake for themselves:</hi> Each breifely may be considered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What fluctuating persons are they, not yet come to any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty in Religion, whō M. B. intends to deale with all? Those, for the most part, of them who seeme to be intended in such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings, are fully perswaded from the Scripture, of the Truth of those things, wherein they have ben instructed. Of these, some (I have heard) have been unsetled by M. <hi>B.</hi> but that he shall ever settle any (there being no consistency in errour or falsehood) is impossible. M. <hi>B.</hi> knowes, there is no one of the Catechists he so decryes, but directs them whom he so instructs, to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and settles their Faith on the Word of God alone: though they labour to thelpe their Faith and understanding, by opening of it, whereunto also they are called. I feare M <hi>B's.</hi> certainty will at length appeare to be <hi>Scepticisme;</hi> and his

Who can make that straight, which is crooked; or number that which is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? If by <hi>our Religion</hi> he meanes the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> It may well be inquired, who they are with their just and pious desires, who yet understand not the Truth of Christian Religion? That is, that it is the only true Religion; When we know these <hi>Turks, Jewes, Pagans,</hi> which Mr <hi>Biddle</hi> hath to deale with all, we shall be able to judge of what Reason he had to labour to satisfie their <hi>Just and pious desires.</hi> I would also willingly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how they came to so high an advancement in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as to desire to be <hi>brought up in it, and to be able to instruct others,</hi> when as yet they doe not understand the truth of it, or are not satisfyed therein. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. And these are Admirable men, so the way he takes for their satisfaction is admirable also; that is, by asserting nothing; He that asserts nothing, proves nothing, for that hwich any one proves, that he asserts; Intending then to bring men to a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty who yet understand not the truth of our Religion,</hi> he <hi>asserts</hi> nothing, proves nothing, (as is the manner of some) but leaves them to themselves: A most compendious way of teaching, (for whose attainement Mr <hi>B.</hi> needed not to have been Master of Arts) if it proves effectuall. But by not asserting, it is evident M. B. intends not silence; He hath said too much to be so interpreted. Only what he hath spoken, he hath done it in a <hi>scepticall</hi> way of inquirie; wherein though the intendment of his mind be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and all his Queries may be easily resolved into so many propositions or Assertions, yet as his words lye, he supposes he may speake truly, that he <hi>asserts</hi> nothing. Of the truth then of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:115372:46"/> this Assertion, that he <hi>doth not assert any thing,</hi> the Reader will judge. And this is the path to Atheisme which of all others is most trod and beaten in the dayes wherein we live. A liberty of judgement is pretended, and Queries are proposed, untill no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing certaine be left, nothing unshaken. But</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He introduces the Scripture, Faithfully uttering its owne Assertions;</hi> If his owne testimony concerning his faithfull dealing, may be taken, this must passe. The expresse words of the Scripture, I confesse are produced; but as to M. <hi>B's</hi> faithfulnesse in their production, I have sundry exceptions to make.</p>
            <p>As 1. That by his leading Questions, and Application of the Scripture to them, he hath utterly perverted the Scope and Intendment of the places urged. Whereas he pretends not to <hi>assert</hi> or <hi>explaine</hi> the Scripture, he most undoubtedly restraines the signfication of the places by him alleadged, unto the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise scope, which in his <hi>sophisticall Queries</hi> he hath included; and in such a way of proceedure, what may not the <hi>Serpentine</hi> wits of men, pretend to a confirmation of, from Scripture, oir any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book, that hath been written about such things, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires are made after. It were easy to give innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of this kind: but we feare God, and dare not to make bold with him or his word.</p>
            <p n="2">2. M. <hi>B.</hi> pretending to give an account of the chiefest things <hi>pertaining</hi> to beliefe and practice, doth yet propose no question at all, concerning many of the most important Heads of our Religion, and whereunto the Scripture speaks fully, and expressely; or proposes his thoughts in the <hi>negative,</hi> leading on the Scriptures, from whence he makes his objections to the grand Truths he opposeth, concealing (as was said) the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of them in the Scripture, in other places innumerable: so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuating to the men <hi>of just and pious desires,</hi> with whom he hath to doe, that the Scripture is silent of them. That this is the mans way of proceedure, in reference to <hi>the Deity of Christ,</hi> and of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> the <hi>Satisfaction and Merit of Christ,</hi> the <hi>corruption of Nature,</hi> and <hi>Efficacy of Grace,</hi> with many other most important heads of Christian Religion, will be fully manifest in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of the severall particulars, as they shall occurre, in the method wherein by him they are handled.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What can be concluded of the mind of God, in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:115372:47"/> by cutting of any place, or places of it, from their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, connection, and tendency, catching at those words which seeme to confirme what we would have them so to doe, (whether in the proper order, wherein of God they are set and fixed, they doe in the least cast an eye towards the <hi>Thesis,</hi> which they are produced to confirme or no) might easily be manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted, by innumerable instances, were not the vanity of such a course, evident to all. On the consideration of these few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to M. B's way of proceedure, it will easily appeare, what little advantage he hath given him thereby, and how unjust his pretence is, which by this course he aimes to prevaile upon men withall. This he opens p. 6. <hi>none</hi> (saith he) <hi>can fall upon the things contained in his Catechisme</hi> (which he confesseth to be quite contrary to the Doctrine that passeth <hi>current among the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Christians) as they are here displayed, because the Answers are transcribed out of the Scriptures.</hi> But M. B. may be pleased to take notice, that the <hi>displaying</hi> (as he calls it) of his Doctrines, is the worke of his Questions, and not of the words of Scripture, produced to confirme them; which have a sence cunningly and subtilly imposed on them, by his Queries, or are pointed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to the things, which in the place of their delivery, they looke not towards in any measure. We shall undoubtedly find in the processe of this businesse, that M. B's Questions being found guilty of treason against God, will not be allowed Sanctuary in the Answers which they labour to creepe into, &amp; that they disclaiming their protection, they may be pursued, taken, and given up to the justice and severity of Truth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least profanation of their holinesse. A murtherer may be plucked from the hornes of the Altar.</p>
            <p>Nor is that the only Answer infisted on, for the removall of M. <hi>B's Sophistry,</hi> which he mentions <hi>pag.</hi> 7. and pursues it for three or foure leaves onward of his Preface: <hi>viz. That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which he urgeth, doe in the letter hold out such things as he alledgeth them to prove, but yet they must be figuratively interpreted.</hi> For (M. B's <hi>Mysticall</hi> sence) I know not what he intends by it, or by whom, it is urged.) This is applyable solely to the places he produceth for the description of God &amp; his Attributes, concerning whom, that some expressions of Scripture, are to be so interpreted, himselfe confesses <hi>pag.</hi> 13. and we desire to take leave to inquire
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115372:47"/> whether some others, beside what M. B. allowes, may not be of the same Consideration. In other things, for the most part, we have nothing at all to do with so much as the interpretation of the places he mentions, but only to remove the grosly Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall insinuations of his Queries; For instance, when M. B. askes, <hi>whether Christ Jesus were not a man or no,</hi> &amp; alledgeth expresse Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture affirming that he was; we say not, that the Scripture must have a Figurative interpretation, but that M. B. is grossly <hi>Sophisticall,</hi> Concluding from the assertion of Christs <hi>humane nature,</hi> to the denyall of his <hi>divine;</hi> and desperately injurious to the persons with whom he pretends he hath to do, who as yet <hi>understand not the truth of our Religion,</hi> in undertaking to declare to them the speciall chiefe things of beliefe and practice, &amp; hiding from them the things of the greatest moment to their Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and which the Scripture speakes most plentifully unto; by not stating any question, or making any such Inquiry, as their Affirmation might be suited unto. The like Instance may be given in all the particulars, wherein M. B. is departed from the <hi>Faith once delivered to the Saints.</hi> His whole following discourse then, to the end of <hi>pag.</hi> 13<seg rend="sup">th</seg>, wherein he decryes the answer to his way of procedure, which himselfe had framed, he might have spared. It is true, we do affirm that there are figurative expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Scripture (&amp; M. B dares not say the contrary) and that they are accordingly to be interpreted: Not that they are to have a <hi>mysticall</hi> sence put upon them, but that the literall sence is to be received, according to the direction of the Figure which is in the words. That those words of our <hi>Saviour, this is my body,</hi> are <hi>figurative,</hi> I suppose M. B. will not deny. Interpret them according to the figurative import of them, and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation gives you the <hi>Literall,</hi> and not a mysticall sence, if such figures belong to speech and not to sence. That sence, (I Confesse) may be <hi>spiritually</hi> understood (then it is saving) or otherwise but this doth not constitute different sences in the words, but only denote a difference in the understādings of men. But all this in <hi>hypothesi</hi> M. B. fully grants <hi>pag.</hi> 9. so that there is no danger by asserting it, to cast the least thought of uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the Word of God. But <hi>pag.</hi> 10. He gives you an instance, wherein this kind of interpretation must by no meanes be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>viz. in the Scriptures Attributions of a shape, similitude,</hi> (that is, of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115372:48"/> Eyes, Ears, Hands, Feet) <hi>unto God with passions &amp; affections like unto us;</hi> which that they are not <hi>proper,</hi> but <hi>figuratively</hi> to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, He tels you (<hi>pag.</hi> 10, 11, 12.) <hi>those affirme, who are perverted by false Philosophy, and make a nose of wax of the Scripture, which plainly affirms such things of God.</hi> In what sence the expressions of Scripture intimated, concerning God, are necessarily to be received, and understood, the ensuing Considerations will enforme the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. For the present I shall only say, that I doe not know scarce a more unhappy instance, in his whole Book, that he could have produced, then this; wherein he hath been blasphemously Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious unto God, and his holy Word.

            <p>We say indeed (as M. B. observes) that in those kinds of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, <hi>God condescendeth to accommodate his wayes and proceedings (not his Essence and being</hi>) to our apprehensions, wherein we are very far from saying, that he <hi>speaks one thing &amp; imends the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary;</hi> but only that the thing that he ascribes to himselfe, for our understanding, and the accommodation of his proceedings, to the manner of men, are to be understood in him, and of them, <note n="i" place="margin">Quae dicun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur de Deo <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>.</note> in that which they denote of perfection, &amp; not in respect of that which is imperfect and weake. For instance, when God says, <hi>his eyes run to and froe to behold the Sons of men,</hi> we doe not say, that he <hi>speaks one thing and understands another,</hi> but only because we have our knowledge and acquaintance with things by our Eyes, looking up &amp; down, therefore doth he, who hath not eyes of flesh, as we have, nor hath any need, to looke up and downe, to acquaint himselfe with all whose wayes are in his own hand, nor can without blasphemy be supposed to looke from one thing to another, chose to expresse his knowledge of, and intimate acquaintance with all things here below, in, and by his own infinite understanding, in the way so suited to our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensiō. Neither are these kinds of expression in the least an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or doe give advantage to any, of creating any shape of God in their imaginations; God having plainly and clearely in the same word of his, wherein these expressions are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115372:48"/> used, discovered <hi>that</hi> of himselfe, his Nature, Being, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertyes, which will necessarily determine, in what sence those expressions are to be understood; as in the consideration of the severall particulars in the ensuing Discourse, the Reader will find evinced. And we are yet of the mind, that to conceive of God, as a Great Man, with Mouth, Eyes, Hands, Leggs &amp;c. in a proper sence, <hi>sitting in Heaven,</hi> shut up there, <hi>troubled, vexed, moved</hi> up and down with sundry <hi>passions,</hi> perplexed about the things that are to come to passe, which he knowes not, which is the notion of God, that M. B. labours to deliver the world from their darknesse withall, is grosse Idolatry: whereunto the <hi>Scripturall</hi> Attributions unto God mentioned, give not the least countenance, as will in the progresse of our Discourse more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare. And if it be true which M. B. intimates, that <hi>things implying imperfection</hi> (speaking of sleep, and being weary) <hi>are not properly Attributed to God,</hi> I doubt not but I shall easily evince, that the same line of refusall, is to passe over the <hi>visible shape,</hi> and <hi>turbulent affections,</hi> which are by him ascribed to him; but of these more particularly in their respective places.</p>
            <p>But he addes, <hi>That this consideration is so pressing, (pag. 13, 14.) that a certaine learned Author, in his Book entituled [Conjectura Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>listica] affirmes, that for Moses by occasion of his writing to let the Jewes entertaine a conceit of God as in humane shape, was not any more a way to bring them unto Idolatry, then by acknowledging man to be God, as our Religion doth in part:</hi> which plea of his M. B. exagitates in the pages following. That <hi>learned Gentleman,</hi> is of Age and Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to speake for himselfe; for mine owne part, I am not so cleare in what he affirmes, as to undertake it for him; though otherwise very ready to serve him, upon the account which I have of his worth, and Abilityes; though I may freely say, I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose they might be better exercised, then in such <hi>Cabalisticall Conjectures,</hi> as the booke of his, pointed unto, is full of. But who am I that judge another: we must every one give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of himselfe and his labours to God: and the fire shall try our workes of what sort they are; I shall not desire to make too much worke for the fire. For the present I deny that <hi>Moses</hi> in his writings, doth give any occasion to entertaine a Conceit of God, as one of an <hi>humane shape.</hi> Neither did the <hi>Jewes</hi> ever stumble into Idolatry, on that account. They sometimes indeed,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:115372:49"/> Changed their Glory, for that which was not God. But whilst they worshipped that God, that revealed himselfe by <hi>Moses, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah, Ehejeh,</hi> it doth not appeare, that ever they entertained in their thoughts any thing but <hi>purum nuvren,</hi> a most simple, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, Eternal being, as I shall give a farther account afterwards. Though they intended to worship <hi>Jehovah</hi> both in the Calfe in the Wildernes, and in those at <hi>Bethel,</hi> yet that they ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained any thoughts, that God had such a shape, as that which they framed to worship him by, is madnesse to imagine. For though <hi>Moses</hi> sometimes speakes of God in the condescention before mentioned, expressing his <hi>Power</hi> by his Arme, and <hi>Bow,</hi> and <hi>Sword;</hi> his knowledge and understanding, by his <hi>Eye;</hi> yet he doth in so many places caution them, with whom he had to do, of entertaining any thoughts of any bodily <hi>similitude</hi> of God, that by any thing delivered by him, there is not the least occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion administred, for the entertaining of such a conceit, as is intimated. Neither am I cleare in the <hi>Theologicall predication,</hi> which that learned Person hath chosen to parallell with the <hi>Mosaicall</hi> expressions of Gods <hi>Shape,</hi> and similitude, concerning <hi>man being God;</hi> Though we acknowledge him who is man, to be God, yet we doe not acknowledge <hi>man</hi> to be God. Christ un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this <hi>reduplication, as man,</hi> is not a person, and so not <hi>God.</hi> To say that man is God, is to say, that the Humanity, and Deity are the same; what ever he is as man, he is upon the account of his being man; Now that he who is man, is also God, though he be not God, uppon the account of his being man, can give no more occasion to Idolatry, then to say that God is Infinite, Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. For the expression it selfe, it being in the concrete, it may be salved by the communication of propertyes: but as it lyes, it may possibly be taken in the abstract, and so is simply false. Neither do I judge it safe to use such expressions, unlesse it be when the grounds and reasons of them are assigned. But that M. B. should be offended with this Assertion, I see no Reason. Both he and his associates affirme, that Jesus Christ as man, (being in Essence and nature nothing but man) is made a God, and is the object of Divine worship, or Religious Adoration on that account. I may therefore let passe M. B's following Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue against mens <hi>Phylosophicall speculations, desserting the Scripture in their centemplations of the nature of God; as though they could speake
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:115372:49"/> more worthily of God then he hath done of himselfe.</hi> For though it may easily be made appeare, that never any of the <hi>Platonicall Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers</hi> spake so unworthily of God, or vented such grosse carnall conceptions of him, as M. B. hath done, and the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of whom he speakes, be well able to judge of what he reades, and to free himselfe from being intangled in any of their notions, discrepant from the Revelation that God hath made of himselfe in his Word, yet we being resolved to try out the whole matter, and to put all the differences we have with M. B. to the tryall and Issue, upon the expresse Testimony of God himselfe, in his word, are not concerned in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>Neither have I any necessity to divert to the Consideration of his complaint, concerning <hi>the bringing in of new expressions into Religion;</hi> if he intends such, as whose substance or matter, which they do expresse, is not evidently and expresly found in the Scripture; What is the <hi>Babylonish Language, what are the horrid and intricate Expressions,</hi> which he affirmes <hi>to be introduced, under a Colour of detecting and confuting Heresyes, but indeed to put a bafle uppon the simplicity of the Scripture,</hi> he gives us an account of <hi>pag.</hi> 19. where we shall consider it, &amp; them.

I suppose allowes expositions of Scriptures, or else I am sure, he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes himselfe</hi> in what he practises. His booke is in his owne thoughts, an Exposition of Scripture. That this cannot be done without varying the words and literall expressions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I suppose will not be questioned. To expresse the same thing, that is contained in any place of Scripture, with such o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words as may give light unto it, in our understandings, is to expound it. This are we called to. And the course of it is to continue, whilst Christ continues a Church upon the Earth. <hi>Paul</hi> spake nothing for the substance of the things he delivered, but what was written in the Prophets. That he did not use new Expressions, not to be found in any of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, will not be proved. But there is a twofold evill in these expressions. (i.) <hi>That they are invented to detect and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Heresies, as is pretended.</hi> If Hereticks begin first to wrest Scripture expressions, to a sence never received, nor contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115372:50"/> in them, it is surely lawfull for them, who are willing to <hi>Contend for the Faith once delivered to the Saints,</hi> to cleare the mind of God, in his Word by Expressions and termes suitable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. <note n="l" place="margin">

               </gap>, was made use of by the first <hi>Nicene Councell,</hi> to expresse the unity of Essence and Being that is in the Father and Sonne, the better to obviate <hi>Arius</hi> and his followers, with their <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and the like formes of speech, no where found in Scripture, and invented on set purpose, to destroy the true and Eternall Deity of the Sonne of God. If now any man should scruple the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115372:50"/> of that Word, but withall should profes, that he believes <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> to be God equall to the father, one with him from the beginning, and doth not explaine himselfe by other termes, not found in the Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi> that he was made a God, and is one with the Father as to will, not Essence, and the like, he is like to undergoe neither trouble nor oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition from me. We know what troubles arose between the East and Westerne Churches, about the words <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postasis</hi> and <hi>Persona,</hi> untill they understood on each side, that by these different Words, the same thing was intended; and that <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> among the Greekes, as to their application to the thing, the one &amp; the other expressed by those termes that such <hi>monstrous termes are brought into our Religion, as neither they that invented them; nor they that use them, doe understand,</hi> M. B. may be allowed to aver, from the measure he hath taken of all mens understandings, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in his owne; and saying, <hi>thus farre can they goe and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> this they can understand, that they cannot. A presogative, as we shall see in the processe of this busines, that he will scarsely allow to God himselfe, without his taking much paines and labour about it. I professe for my part, I have not as yet the least conviction fallen upon me, that M. B. is furnished with so large an understanding, what ever he insinuates of his <hi>owne abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lityes,</hi> as to be allowed a <hi>Dictator</hi> of what any man can, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand. If his principle, or rather conclusion, upon which he limits the understandings of men, be this, what I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not understand that no man else can, he would be desired to cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that he is as yet but a young man, who hath not had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Advātages and helps, for the improving of his understanding, as some others have had; and besides, that there are some, whose Eyes are blinded by the God of this world, that they shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver see nor understand the things of God; yea and that God himselfe, doth thus oftentimes execute his vengenace on them, for detaining his Truth in unrighteousnesse.</p>
            <p>But yet upon this acquaintance, which he hath with the measure of all mens understandings, he informes his Reader, that the <hi>only way to carry on the Reformation of the Church, beyond what yet hath been done by Luther or Calvin, is by casheiring those many intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115372:51"/> termes and devised formes of speaking, which he hath observed, slily to couch false Doctrines, and to obtrude them on us. And by the way, that this carrying on Reformation, beyond the stint of Luther or Galvin, was never yet so much as sincerely endeavoured.</hi> In the former passage, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given out himselfe, as a Competent Judge of the <hi>understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings</hi> of all men, in this he proceeds to their <hi>Hearts. The Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church</hi> (saith he) was never <hi>sincerely attempted, beyond the stint of Luther and Calvin;</hi> attempted it hath been, but he knowes all the men, &amp; their hearts ful well, who made those attempts, and that they never did it <hi>sincerely,</hi> but with <hi>guile</hi> and <hi>Hypocrysy;</hi> M. B. knowes who those are that say; <hi>with our tongue we will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, our lips are our own.</hi> To know the hearts of men, &amp; their frame towards himselfe, M. B. instructs us in his <hi>Catechisme,</hi> that God himselfe is forced to make tryall, and experiments. But for his owne part, without any great trouble he can easily pronounce of their sincerity, or hypocrisy, in any undertaking; Low and vile thoughts of God, will quickly usher in light, proud, and foolish thoughts concerning our selves. <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> were men whom God honoured above many in their Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and on that account, we dare not but do so also. That all Church Reformation, is to be measured by their line, that is, that no farther discovery of Truth in, or about, or concerning the wayes or workes of God, may be made, but what hath been made to them, and by them, was not that I know of, ever yet affirmed, by any in, or of any <hi>Reformed Church in the World;</hi> The truth is, such attempts as this of M. <hi>B's,</hi> to overthrow all the foundations of Christian Religion, to accomodate the Gospell to the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> &amp; subject all divine mysteries to the Judgement of that <hi>Wisdome,</hi> which is <hi>Carnall</hi> &amp; <hi>sensuall,</hi> under the faire pretence of carrying on the worke of Reformation, and discovering Truth from the Scripture, hath perhaps fixed some men to the measure they have received, beyond what Christian Ingenuity, and the love of the truth requireth of them. A noble and free inquiry into the Word of God, with attendance to all wayes by him appointed, or allowed, for the Revelation of his mind, with reliance on his gratious Promise of <hi>leading us into all truth</hi> by his holy &amp; blessed Spirit, without whose ayde, guidance; direction light, &amp; assistance, we can neither know, understand, nor receive the things that are of God, neither captivated to the traditions of our Fathers, for whose labour and paines in the worke of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115372:51"/> the Gospell, and for his presence with them, we dayly blesse the name of our God, neither yet carryed about with every wind of Doctrine, breathed or insinuated by the <hi>Cunning slights of men, who lye in wait to deceive,</hi> is that which we professe. What the Lord will be pleased to do with us, by, or in this frame, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these principles, how, wherein we shall serve our Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in the Revelation of his mind and will, is in his hand, and disposall. About using, or casting off Words, and Phrases; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly used to expresse any Truth, or doctrine of the Scripture, we will not contend with any; provided the things themselves signifyed by them, be retained. This alone makes me indeed, put any value on any word, or expression, not <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> found in the Scripture; namely, my observation that they are questioned &amp; rejected by none, but such, as by their rejection, intend &amp; ayme at the removall of the truth it selfe, which by them is expressed, and plentifully revealed in the Word. The same care also was among them of old, having the same occasion administred. <note n="l" place="margin">Theodoret Hist: Eccles. lib. 4. cap, 17. p. 126. Socrat: lib: 4. cap: 21, 22.

And by none, is there more strength &amp; Evidence given to this observation, then by him, with whō I have now to do; who exclaiming against words and expressions, intends really, the subversion of all the most Fundamentall and substantiall Truths of the Gospell: And therefore having p. 19, 20, 21. reckoned up many Expressiōs which he dislikes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes,

What need then all this long discourse about words and expressions, when it is the <hi>things themselves</hi> signifyed by them, that are the Abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons decryed? Now though most of the Things here pointed unto, will fall under our ensuing Considerations, yet because M.

            <p>His first is, of <hi>Gods being Infinite and incomprehensible.</hi> This he condemnes, <hi>name and thing,</hi> that is, He sayes, <hi>He is Finite, Limited,</hi> of us to be comprehended.

               </note> And in this, as sundry other things, M. <hi>B.</hi> excells his Masters.

The like expressions are used of him in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance.

               </note> Being, which in his mind he conceived, then M. B. will allow us to entertaine of God.

If He be fixed there, how can He worke at a distance, especially such things as necessarily require Divine Power to their Production. If He move up and down, and journey as his occasions require, what a blessed injoyment of Himselfe in his own Glory hath He? But that this blasphemous figment, of Gods being limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and confined to a certaine place, is really destructive to all the Divine perfections of the nature and Being of God, is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards demonstrated. And this is the first instance given by M.

               </note> Those who affirme God to be <hi>a simple Act,</hi> do only deny him to be compounded of diverse principles, &amp; assert him to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes actually in Being, Existence, &amp; intent Operation. God sayes of himselfe, that his name is <hi>Ehejeh.</hi> &amp; He is <hi>I AM,</hi> that is, a <hi>simple Being,</hi> Existing in, and of it selfe. And this is that, which is intended by the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the the nature of God, and his being a <hi>simple Act.</hi> The Scripture tells us he is Eternall: <hi>I Am:</hi> alwayes the same, and so never, what he was not ever. This is decryed, and in opposition to it, his being compounded,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115372:53"/> and so being obnoxious to dissolution, and his being <hi>in potentia,</hi> in a <hi>disposition,</hi> and passive capacity to be what he is not, is asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for it is only to deny these things, that the terme, <hi>simple,</hi> is used, which he condemnes and rejects: And this is the second instance that M. B. gives in the description of his God, by his rejecting the received expressions concerning him who is so. He is <hi>limited,</hi> &amp; of us to be <hi>comprehended;</hi> His Essence, &amp; Being consisting of severall Principles, whereby he is in a capacity of being what he is not. M. B. <hi>solus habeto.</hi> I will not be your Rivall in the favour of this God.</p>
            <p>And this may suffice to this Exception of M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> by the way, against the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the being of God: yet because he doth not directly oppose it afterwards, and the asserting of it, doth clearely evert all his following fond imaginations of the <hi>Shape, Corporeity,</hi> and <hi>limitednesse</hi> of the Essence of God, (to which end also, I shall in the consideration of his severall depravations of the Truth, concerning the nature of God, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon it) I shall a little here divert to the explication of what we intend by the <hi>simplicity of the Essence of God,</hi> and confirme the truth of what we so intend, thereby.</p>
            <p>As was then intimated before, though <hi>simplicity</hi> seeme to be a <hi>positive</hi> terme, or to denote something <hi>positively,</hi> yet indeed it is a pure <note n="s" place="margin">Suarez: Metaph: Tom 2. disput. 30. § 3. Cajetan: de Ente &amp; Essen: cap: 2.</note> negation; and <hi>formally, immediately,</hi> &amp; properly, denyes <hi>multiplication, composition,</hi> &amp; the like. And yet though this only it immediately denote, yet there is a most eminent perfection of the nature of God thereby signified to us, which is negatively proposed, because it is in the use of things that are proper to us, in which case we can only conceive, what is not to be ascribed to God. Now not to insist on the <hi>metaphysicall notions &amp; distinctions</hi> of <hi>simplicity,</hi> by the ascribing of it to God, we do not only deny, that he is <hi>compounded</hi> of divers principles, really distinct, but also of such as are <hi>improper,</hi> and not of such a reall distance; or that he is compounded of any thing, or can be compounded with any thing whatever.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, that this is a <hi>property of Gods Essence,</hi> or Being, is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, from his <hi>absolute independence</hi> and <hi>firstnesse,</hi> in being, and operation, which God often insists upon, in the Revelation of himselfe <hi>Isa. 44. 6. I am the first, &amp; I am the last, &amp; besides me there is no God. Revel. 1. 8. I am Alpha, and Omega, the beginning, and the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115372:53"/> ending, saith the Lord, which is &amp;c.</hi> so <hi>Chap.</hi> 21. 6. and <hi>chap.</hi> 22. 13. which also is fully asserted <hi>Ro.</hi> 11. 35, 36. <hi>who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him againe, for of him, and through him, and to him are all things, to him be Glory for ever.</hi> Now if God were of any causes, internall or externall, any principles, antecedent or superiour to him, he could not be so absolutely <hi>First,</hi> and <hi>Independent.</hi> Were he composed of parts, accidents, manner of being, he could not be <hi>First;</hi> For all these are before that which is of them, and therefore his Essence is absolutely <hi>Simple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. God is absolutely and perfectly <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>same,</hi> and nothing differs from his essence in it: <hi>The Lord is one Lord, Deut. 6. 4. Thou art the same Ps.</hi> 102. 27. And where there is an <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute onenesse,</hi> and <hi>samenesse</hi> in the whole, there is no <hi>composition</hi> by an union of extremes. Thus is it with God: his name is <hi>I am, I am that I am, Exod. 3. 14, 15. Which is, Revel,</hi> 1. 8. He then who is what he is, and whose all, that is in him, is himselfe, hath neither parts, accidents, principles, or any thing else, whereof his Essence should be <hi>compounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Attributes</hi> of God, which alone seeme to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct things in the <hi>Essence</hi> of God, are all of them essentially the same with one another, and every one the same with the Essence of God, it selfe. For first, they are spoken one of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, as well as of God: as there is his <hi>Eternall Power,</hi> as well as his Godhead. And secondly, they are either <hi>infinite,</hi> and infinitely perfect, or they are not? if they are, then if they are not the same with God, there are more things <hi>infinite</hi> then <hi>one,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently more Gods; for that which is <hi>absolutely infinite,</hi> is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely Perfect, and consequently God. If they are not Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, then God knowes not himselfe, for a finite Wisdome, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not know perfectly an Infinite being. And this might be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther confirmed, by the particular consideration of all kinds of <hi>commposition,</hi> with a manifestation of the impossibility of their Atribution unto God: Arguments to which purpose, the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Reader knowes where to find in abundance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Yea that God is, and must needs be a simple Act, (which expression M. B. fixes on for the rejection of it) is evident, from this one consideration, which was mentioned before: if he be not so, there must be some <hi>potentiality</hi> in God. What ever is, and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:115372:54"/> is not a simple Act, hath a possibility to be perfected by Act; if this be in God; he is not <hi>perfect,</hi> nor <hi>alsufficient:</hi> every, composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whatever, is of <hi>power and Act,</hi> which if it be, or might have been in God, He could not be said to be immutable, which the Scripture plentifully witnesseth, that He is.</p>
            <p>These are some few of the Grounds of this Affirmation of ours, concerning the <hi>simplicity</hi> of the Essence of God; which when M. <hi>Biddle</hi> removes and Answers, he may have more of them, which at present there is no necessity to produce.</p>
            <p>From his <hi>Being,</hi> he proceeds to his <hi>subsistence,</hi> and expressly rejects his <hi>subsisting in three Persons, name,</hi> and <hi>thing.</hi> That this is no new attempt, no undertaking, whose Glory M. B. may arrogate to himselfe, is knowne. Hitherto God hath taken thought for his owne Glory, and eminently confounded the Opposers of the <hi>Subsistence of his Essence in three distinct Persons.</hi> Enquire of them that went before, and of the dealings of God with them of old, what is become of <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus, Paulus Samosatenus, Theodorus Byzantihus, Photinus, Arius, Macedonius &amp;c.</hi> hath not God made their memory to rot, and their names to be an abomination to all Generations? How they once attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to have taken possession of the Churches of God, making slaughter and havoke of all that opposed them, hath beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared; but their place long since knows them no more. By the subsisting of God in any Person, no more is intended, then that Person's being God. If that Person be God, God subsists in that Person. If you grant the <hi>Father</hi> to be a <hi>Person</hi> (as the Holy Ghost expressly affirmes him to be, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 21.) and to be God, you grant, <hi>God to subsist in that Person;</hi> that is all which by that Expression is intended. The <hi>Sonne</hi> is God, or is not; To say He is not God, is to <hi>begge</hi> that which cannot be proved. If he be God, He is the <hi>Father,</hi> or He is another <hi>Person?</hi> If He be the <hi>Father,</hi> He is not the <hi>Sonne.</hi> That He is the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and not the <hi>Sonne,</hi> is sufficiently contradictory. If He be not the <hi>Father,</hi> as was said, and yet be <hi>God,</hi> he may have the same <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>substance,</hi> with the Father, (for of our God there is but one Essence, nature, or being) and yet be distinct from him. That distinction from him, is his <hi>Personality;</hi> that Property, whereby, and from whence, He is the <hi>Sonne.</hi> The like is to be said of the Holy Ghost; The thing then here denyed, is, that the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:115372:54"/>
               <hi>Sonne</hi> is God, or that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is God. For if they are so, God must <hi>subsist in three Persons,</hi> of which more afterwards. Now is this not to be found in the Scriptures? Is there no Text affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Christ to be God, to be one with the Father, or that the Holy Ghost is so? No Text saying, there are <hi>three that beare witnesse in Heaven, and these three are one?</hi> None ascribing divine <hi>Perfections,</hi> divine <hi>Worship,</hi> distinctly to either Sonne, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? And yet joyntly to one God? Are none of these things, found in the Scripture, that M. B. thinks with one blast, to demolish all these antient foundations, and by his bare Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to deny the Common Faith of the present Saints, and that wherein their Predecessors, in the Worship of God, are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len asleepe in peace. The proper place for the consideration of these things, will farther manifest the Abomination of this bold Attempt, against the <hi>Sonne</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>eternall Spirit.</hi>

            <p>For the divine <hi>Circumincession</hi> mentioned in the next place. I shal only say that it is not at all in my intention to defend all Expressions, that any men have used (who are yet sound in the maine) in the unfolding of this great, tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Mystery of the blessed Trinity, and could heartily wish, that they had some of them, bin lesse curious in their inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and lesse bold in their expressions. It is the thing it selfe alone, whose Faith I desire to owne and professe; and therefore shall not in the least labour to retaine and hold those Things or words, which may be left, or lost, without any prejudice thereunto.</p>
            <p>Briefely, by the barbarous terme of <hi>mutuall circumincession,</hi> the Schoolemen understand that, which the Greeke Fathers called <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, whereby they expressed that mystery, which Christ himselfe teaches us, <hi>of his being in the Father, and the Father in him. John 10. 38.</hi> and of the Fathers <hi>remaining in him, and doing the workes he did, Ioh. 14. 10.</hi> The <hi>distinction</hi> of the Persons, being not hereby taken away, but the <hi>disjunction</hi> of them, as to their nature and being.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Eternall Generation of the Sonne,</hi> is in the Next place re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected; that he may be sure to cast down every thing, that lookes toward the Assertion of his Deity, whom yet the Apostle affirms, to be <hi>God blessed for evermore Rom.</hi> 9. 5. That the <hi>Word, which in the beginning was</hi> (and therefore is) <hi>God,</hi> is the only begotten

Christ then being begotten <hi>of the Father,</hi> hath his <hi>Generation</hi> of the Father; for these are the very same things, in words of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse sound; The only question here is, whether the Sonne have the Generation, so often spoken of, from <hi>Eternity,</hi> or in <hi>time?</hi> whether it be an <hi>Eternall,</hi> or a <hi>temporall</hi> Generation, from whence he is so said to be begotten. As Christ is a <hi>Sonne,</hi> so by him the <hi>Worlds were made Heb.</hi> 1. 2. So that surely he had his Sonship before he <hi>tooke flesh in the fulnesse of time.</hi> And when he had his Sonship he had his Generation. He is such a sonne, as by being partaker of that Name, he is exalted above <hi>Angels Heb.</hi> 1. 5. And is the <hi>first begotten, before he is brought into the World,</hi> and therefore his goings forth, are said to be from the <hi>Dayes of Eternity Micah.</hi> 5. 2. and he had Glory <hi>with the Father,</hi> (as the Sonne) <hi>before the world was John</hi> 17. 5. Neither is he said to be begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in respect of his incarnation, but conceived by the Holy Ghost, or formed in the wombe by him, of the substance of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>other, nor is he thence called the Sonne of God.</p>
            <p>In briefe, if Christ be the Eternall Sonne of God, M. B. will not deny him to have had an <hi>Eternall Generation;</hi> if he be not, a Generation must be found out for him, sutable to the Sonship which he hath; of which Abomination in its proper place. This progresse have we made in Mr <hi>B's</hi> Creed: He believes God to be <hi>Finite,</hi> to be by us <hi>Comprehended, Compounded:</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves there is no <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons</hi> in the Godhead; that Christ is not the <hi>Eternall Sonne of God.</hi> The following parts of it are of the same kind. The <hi>Eternall procession</hi> of the Holy Ghost, is nextly rejected. The Holy Ghost being constantly termed the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of the Sonne,</hi> (being also God, as shall afterwards be evinced,) and so partakes of the same nature with <hi>Father and Sonnes</hi> (the Apostle granting that God hath a <hi>nature,</hi> in his rejecting of them, who by <hi>nature, are not Gods,</hi>) is yet distinguished from them, and that <hi>Eternally,</hi> (as nothing is in the Deity that is not Eternall;) and being more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over

               </gap>, or to <hi>proceed,</hi> and <hi>goe forth</hi> from the <hi>Father</hi> &amp; <hi>Sonne,</hi> this expression of his Eternall Procession hath been fixed on: manifesting the <hi>Property</hi> whereby he is distinguished from Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Sonne. The thing intended hereby is, that the Holy Ghost who is God, and is said to be of the Father, &amp; the Sonne, is by that name, <hi>of his being of them,</hi> distinguished from them; and the denyall hereof, gives you one Article more of M. B's Creed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the <hi>Holy Ghost is not God.</hi> To what that expression of <hi>proceeding</hi> is to be accommodated, will afterwards be considered. The <hi>Incarnation of Christ,</hi> (the Deity and Trinity being dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) is called into Question, &amp; rejected. By <hi>Incarnation,</hi> is meant, (as the word imports) a <hi>taking of flesh,</hi> (this is <note n="t" place="margin">

We thought we might have been allowed to say <hi>so</hi> also, and that this Expression might have escaped with a lesse censure, then an utter Rejection out of <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> The Sonne of God, <hi>taking flesh,</hi> and so being made like to us, that he might be the Captaine of our salvation, is that which by this word, and that according to the Scripture, is affirmed, and which to increase the heape of former abominations, (or to carry on the work of Reformation beyond the stint of <hi>Luther</hi> or <hi>Calvin</hi>) is here by M.

            <p>Of the <hi>Hypostaticall Ʋnion,</hi> there is the same Reason: Christ, who as <hi>concerning the flesh,</hi> was of the Jewes, and is, <hi>God to be blessed for ever, over all Ro.</hi> 19. 5. is one person: Being God to be blessed o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all, that is, God by nature, (for such as are not so, and yet take upon them to be Gods, God will destroy,) and having <hi>Flesh and Bloud,</hi> as the Children have <hi>Heb:</hi> 2. 14. that is, the same nature of man with Belivers, yet being but one Person, one Mediator, one Christ, the Sonne of God, we say both these Natures of God and Men, are united in that one Person, <hi>viz.</hi> the Person of the Sonne of God. This is that which M. B. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, (now his hand is in) both <hi>name and thing.</hi> The truth is, all these things are but colourable advantages, wherewith he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:115372:56"/> to amuze poore soules; grant the Deity of Christ, and he knowes all these particulars will necessarily ensue; and whilest he denies the foundation, it is to no purpose to contend about any consequences or inferences whatever. And whither we have ground for the expression under present consideration; <hi>Joh. 1. 14, 18. Joh: 20. 28. Act. 20. 28. Rom: 1. 3, 4. Rom: 9. 5. Gals 4. 4.

               <hi>Of Christs being punished by God,</hi> which he rejects in the next place, and to multiply his instances of our false doctrine, insists on it againe under the termes, of <hi>Christs enduring the wrath of God, and the paines of a Damned man,</hi> the same account is to be given, as before of his satisfaction. <note n="k" place="margin">Isa: 53. 5, 6, &amp;c.

            <p>The false doctrine of the <hi>merit of Christ,</hi> and his <hi>purchasing for us the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> is the next stone, which this <hi>Master Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> disallowes and rejects: <note n="l" place="margin">1 Cor: 6. 20. 1 Pet. 1. 18.

B. at once condemned, this also hath its place.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Christ rose from the dead by his own power,</hi> seemes to us to be true; not only because he affirmed, that he <hi>had power so to do, even to lay down his life, &amp; to take it up again Joh.</hi> 10. 18. but also because he said he would do so, when he had <hi>them destroy the temple, and told them, that in three dayes he would raise it againe:</hi> It is true that this <hi>worke of raising Christ from the dead,</hi> is also ascribed to the Father, and to the Spirit, (as in the worke of his <hi>oblation,</hi> his Father <hi>made his soule an offering for sinne,</hi> &amp; he <hi>offered up himselfe through the Eternall Spirit</hi>) yet this hinders not, but that he was raised by <hi>his owne Power,</hi> his Father and he being <hi>one,</hi> and what worke his Father doth, he doing the same.</p>
            <p>And this is the Account which this <hi>meere Christian</hi> giveth us, concerning his <hi>Faith</hi> in Christ, his Person, and his Grace; He is a <hi>meere man,</hi> that neither <hi>satisfied for our sinnes,</hi> nor <hi>procured Grace,</hi> of <hi>Heaven for us;</hi> And how much this tends to the honour of Christ, and the good of soules, all that <hi>love him in sincerity,</hi> will judge and determine.</p>

            <p>His next Attempt is upon the way, whereby the Scripture affirmes that we come to be made Partakers of the good things which Christ hath done and wrought for us; and in the first place, falls foule upon that, of <hi>apprehending and applying Christs Righteousnesse to our selves by Faith;</hi> that so there may no weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty point of the <hi>doctrine of the Crosse</hi> remaine not condemned (by this wise man) <hi>of folly.</hi> This then goes also <hi>name and thing:</hi> Christ is of God made unto us <hi>Righteousnes,</hi> (that is, <hi>to them that believe on him,</hi> or receive or apprehend him <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 12. <note n="m" place="margin">Rom. 3. 25.

               <hi>of his Resurrection, and to be found not having our owne righteousnesse, which is by the Law, but the Righteousnesse which is by the faith of Christ, Christ being the end of the Law to every one that believeth,</hi> we <note place="margin">Rom: 10. 3, 4.</note> say it is the duty of every one, who is called, to apprehend <hi>Christ by Faith,</hi> and apply his Righteousnesse to him; that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him, as made <hi>Righteousnesse of God to him,</hi> unto justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Peace. And if M. <hi>Biddle</hi> reject this Doctrine, <hi>name and thing;</hi> I pray God give him Repentance, before it be too late, to the acknowledgement of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Of Christ's <hi>being our surety, of Christs paying our debt, of our sinnes imputed to Christ, of Christs righteousnesse imputed to us, of Christs dying to appease the wrath of God, and reconcile him to us,</hi> enough hath been spoken already, to cleare the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, who use these Expressions; &amp; to manifest the truth of that which they intend by them: so that I shall not need a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to consider them, as they lye in this disorderly confused heape, which we have here gathered together.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Justification</hi> by Christ being cashiered, he falls upon our <hi>Sanctification</hi> in the next place, that he may leave us as little of Christians, as he hath done our Saviour of the true <hi>Messiah.

But these trifles and falsityes being renounced, he complaines of the abuse of his darling, that it is called <hi>carnall reason;</hi> which being the only interpreter of Scripture, which he allowes of, he cannot but take it amisse, that it should be so grossely slandered, as to be called <hi>carnall.</hi> The Scripture indeed tells us of a <hi>Naturall man,</hi> that <hi>cannot discerne the things which are of God,</hi> and that they are <hi>foolishnesse to him:</hi> of <note place="margin">1 Cor: 2. 14.

            <p>Of <hi>Spirituall incomes,</hi> there is the same Reason. It is not the <hi>phrase of speech,</hi> but the <hi>thing it selfe</hi> we contend about. That God who is the Father of <hi>Mercy,</hi> and <hi>God of all Consolation,</hi> gives <hi>Mercy, Grace, Joy, Peace, Consolation,</hi> as to whom, so in what manner, or in what degree he pleaseth; The receiving of <hi>these</hi> from God, is by some (and that perhaps not ineptly) termed <hi>Spirituall incomes;</hi> with regard to Gods gracious distributions of his kindnesse, love, goodwill, and the reciving of them. So that it be acknowledged, that we do receive Grace, Mercy, Joy, Consolation, and Peace from God, variously as he pleaseth, we shall not much labour about the significancy of that, or any other expression of the like kind. The Scriptures, mentioning the <hi>goings forth of God,</hi> leave no just cause to M. B. of condemning them, who sometimes call any of his workes, or dispensations, his <hi>outgoings.</hi> His rehearsall of all these particular instances, in doctrines that are found neither <hi>Name</hi> nor <hi>Thing</hi> in Scriptures, M. B. closeth with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which miught be interpreted to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize <hi>as many more,</hi> but that there remaine not, <hi>as many more</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant heads in Christian Religion. The <hi>Nature</hi> of God being abased, the <hi>Deity</hi> &amp; <hi>Grace</hi> of Christ denyed, the sin of our <hi>Natures,</hi> and their renovation by Grace in Christ rejected: M. B's remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Religion, will be found scarce worth the inquiry after, by those whom he undertakes to instruct: there being scarcely any thing left by him, from whence we are peculiarly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Christians: nor any thing that should support the weight of a sinfull soule, which approacheth to God for life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>To prevent the entertainment of such Doctrines as these,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:115372:60"/> M. B. commends the advice of <hi>Paul 2 Tim. 1. 13. hold fast the forme of sound words &amp;c.</hi> then which we know none more wholesome, nor more usefull, for the safeguarding, and defence of those Holy and Heavenly principles of our Religion, which M. B. rejects and tramples on: nor are we at all concerned in his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing discourse, of leaving <hi>Scripture termes, and using Phrases, and expressions coyned by men;</hi> for if we use any word or phrase in the things of God, and his worship, and cannot make good the thing signified thereby, to be founded on, and found in the Scriptures, we will instantly renounce it. But if indeed the words and expressions, used by any of the Ancients, for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and confirmation of the Faith of the Gospell, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Doctrine concerning the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> in the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of it from the Hereticks, which in sundry ages bestir'd themselves (as M. B. now doth) in opposition thereunto, be found consonant to Scriptures, and to signify nothing but what is written therein with the beames of the Sun, perhaps we see more cause to retaine them, from the opposition here made to them by M. B. then formerly we did: considering, that his opposition to <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phrases,</hi> is not for their own sake, but of the <hi>things</hi> intended by them.</p>
            <p>The similitude of the ship, <hi>that losts its first matter and substance, by the addition of new pieces, in way of supplement to the old decayes,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been used by some of our <hi>Divines,</hi> to illustrate the <hi>Roman Apostacy,</hi> and <hi>Traditionall-Additionalls</hi> to the Doctrines of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell, will not stand Mr B. in the least stead; unlesse he be able to prove, that we have lost in the Religion we professe, any one materiall part of what it was, when given over to the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches by Christ and his Apostles, or have added any one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, to what they have provided, and furnished us withall in the Scriptures: which untill he hath done, by these and the like insinuations, he doth but beg the thing in question; which being a matter of so great consequence, and importance as it is, will scarce be granted him on any such termes. I doubt not, but it will appeare to every person whatsoever, in the processe of this businesse, who hath his <hi>senses any thing exercised in the Word, to discerne between good and evill,</hi> and whose eyes the <hi>God of this World hath not blinded,</hi> that the <hi>glorious light of the Gospell of God,</hi> should not shine into their hearts, that Mr B. as wise as he deemes it,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:115372:61"/> &amp; reports himselfe to be, is indeed like the <hi>foolish Woman,</hi> that puts downe her house with <hi>both her hands,</hi> labouring to destroy the house of God with all his strength, pretending that this, and that part of it, doth not originally belong thereto, (or like <note n="s" place="margin">Sophoc. in Ajace. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>For M. B's Abilityes, I have not any thing to do, to call them into question; whether <hi>small</hi> or <hi>great,</hi> he will one day find, that he hath scarce used them to the end for which he is intrusted with them; And when the Lord of his <hi>Tallents,</hi> shall call for an account, it will scarce be comfortable to him, that he hath ingaged them so much to his dishonour, as it will undoubtedly appeare he hath done. I have heard by those of M. B's time, and acquaintance in the <hi>Ʋniversity,</hi> that what abilitye he had then obtained, were it <hi>more</hi> or <hi>lesse,</hi> he still delighted to be excerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of it, in opposition to received truths in Philosophy; and whither an itching desire of novelty, and emerging there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, lye not at the bottome of the course he hath since steared, he may do well to examine himselfe.</p>

            <p>We have not then the least reason in the world, to suppose that M. B was lead into these glorious discoveryes, by <hi>reading of the Scriptures,</hi> much lesse <hi>impartial</hi> reading of them; but that they are all the fruits of a deluded heart, given up righteously of God to <hi>believe a lye,</hi> for the neglect of his word, &amp; contempt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon his Spirit, &amp; Grace, for a right understanding thereof, <hi>by the cunning slights of the formentioned</hi> persons, in some of whose writings, Sathan lyes in <hi>waite to deceive.</hi> And for the body of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which he hath collected, which lyes not in the Answers which are set down in the words of the Scripture, but in the <hi>Interpretations,</hi> and <hi>conclusions,</hi> couched in his <hi>Questions,</hi> I may safely say, it is one of the most corrupt, and abominable, that ever issued from the endeavours of one, who called himselfe a <hi>Christian;</hi> for a proofe of which assertion, I referre the Reader to the ensuing considerations of it. So that whatever promises of successe M. B. is pleased to make unto him, who shall <hi>rumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and dig<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But let God be true, and all men lyers Let the Gospell runne and prosper; and if it be hid to any, it is to them, whom the God of this world hath blinded, that the glorious light thereof, shold not shine into their
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115372:62"/> hearts. What may farther be drawn forth of the same kind with what is in these <hi>Catechismes</hi> delivered, with an imposition of it upon the Scripture, as though any occasion were thence administred thereunto, I know not: but yet doe suppose, that Sathan himselfe is scarce able to furnish the thoughts of men, with many more Abominations of the like length, and breadth, with those here dneavoured to be imposed on simple, unstable soules, unlesse he should ingage them into down right Atheisme, and professed contempt of God. Of what tendency these Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of M. B. are unto <hi>Godlinesse,</hi> which he nextly mentioneth, will in its proper place fall under consideration. It is true, the Gospell is a <hi>doctrine according to Godlinesse,</hi> and aymes at the <hi>promotion of it in the hearts,</hi> and lives of men, in order to the exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the Glory of God. And hence it is, that so soone as any poore deluded soule, falls into the snare of Sathan, and is taken captive under the power of any Errour whatever, the first sleight he puts in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice for the promotion of it, is to declaime about its Excellency and usefullnesse for the furtherance of godlinesse; though himselfe in the meane time, be under the power of darkenesse, and know not in the least what belongs to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, which he professeth to promote. As to what M. B. here drawes forth to that purpose, I shall be bold to tell him, that to the accomplishment of a Godlinesse amongst men, (since the fall of <hi>Adam</hi>) that hath not its rise and foundation in the effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall powerfull changing of the whole man, from <hi>death</hi> to <hi>Life, darkenesse</hi> to <hi>Light, &amp;c.</hi> in the washing of the pollutions of nature by the bloud of Christ, that is not wrought in us, and carryed on by the efficacy of the Spirit of Grace, taking away the heart of stone, and giving a new heart, circumcised to feare the Lord, that is not purchased and procured for us, by the <hi>Oblation,</hi> and <hi>Intercession</hi> of the Lord Jesus, a Godlinesse that is not promoted by the consideration of the vitiousnesse, and corruption of our hearts by nature, and their Alienation from God, and that doth not in a good part of it consist in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying, killing, slaying of the sinne of nature, that dwelleth in us, and an opposition to all the actings and workings of it, A Godlinesse that is performed by our own strength, in yeilding obedience to the precepts of the Word, that by that obedience
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115372:62"/> we may be justified before God, and for it accepted, &amp;c. there is not one tittle, <hi>letter,</hi> nor <hi>iota</hi> in the whole Book of God tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. M. B. closeth his Preface with a commendation of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> their <hi>excellency, and divinity,</hi> with the eminent successe that they shall find who yeild obedience to them, in that they shall be <hi>even in this life equall unto Angells.</hi> His expressions as first view seeme to separate him from his Companions in his Body of Divinity, which he pretends to collect from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, whose low thoughts, bold expressions, concerning the contradictions in them, shall afterwards be pointed unto. But I feare</p>

            <p>And in this kisse of the Scripture with <hi>haile</hi> unto it, there is vile treachery intended, and the betraying of them to the hands of men, to be dealt withall at their pleasure. I desire not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine evill surmises of any (what just occasion soever be given on any other account) concerning things that have not their evidence and conviction in themselves. The bleating of that expression, <hi>The Scriptures are the exactest rule of an holy life,</hi> evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allowing other rules of an holy life, though they be the <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctest,</hi> and admitting other things, or Bookes, into a compartner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with them, in that their use and service, though the <hi>prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence</hi> be given to them, sounds as much to their dishonour, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing spoken of them by any, who ever owned them to have proceeded from God. It is the Glory of the Scriptures, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the <hi>Rule,</hi> but the <hi>only one</hi> of walking with God. If you take any other into <hi>comparison</hi> with it, and allow them in the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to be Rules indeed, though not so <hi>exact</hi> as the Scripture, you do no lesse cast downe the Scripture from its Excellency, then if you denied it to be any Rule at all. It will not lye as <hi>one</hi> of the many, though
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115372:63"/> could be an equality between the obedience, yeilded by us, whilest we are yet sinners, and continue so, (<hi>for if we say we have no sinne we deceive our selves</hi>) and the exact obedience of them who never sinned, but abide in doing the will of God, but the principall, and maine worke of God required in them, and which is the root of all other obedience whatever, being to <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on him whom he hath sent,</hi> to as many <hi>as so believe on him, and so receive him, power is given to become the sonnes of God;</hi> who being so adopted into the great family of Heaven and Earth, which is called after Gods name, and invested with all the priviledges thereof; having <hi>fellowship with the Father and the Sonne,</hi> they are in that regard, even in this life, <hi>equall to Angells.</hi> Having thus brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I could, washed off the paint, that was put upon the Porch of M.

               <p>HIS <hi>second</hi> Chapter which is concerning <hi>God,</hi> his <hi>Essence, Nature,</hi> and <hi>Propertyes,</hi> is <hi>second</hi> to none in his whole Booke, <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> for Blasphemyes and Reproaches of God and his Word.</p>
               <p>The description of God, which he labours to insinuate, is, <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> that he is <hi>one Person, of a visible shape,</hi> and <hi>similitude, finite, limited to a certaine place, mutable, comprehensible, and obnoxious to turbulent passions, not knowing the things that are future,</hi> and which shall be done by the <hi>sonnes</hi> of men, whom none can love withall his <hi>heart,</hi> if he believe him to be <hi>one in three distinct Persons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That this is punctually the Apprehension, and notion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning God, and his Being, which He labours to beget, by his <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> suiting Scripture expressions to the blasphemous <hi>insinuations</hi> of his Questions, will appeare in the consideration of both <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions</hi> and <hi>Answers,</hi> as they lye in the second <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>greater Catechisme.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His first Question is, <hi>How many Gods of Christians are there?</hi> And <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> his Answer is; <hi>One God, Eph.</hi> 4. 6. Whereunto he subjoynes, secondly, <hi>who is this one God?</hi> And Answers, <hi>The Father of whom are all things,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 6.</p>

                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:115372:64"/> the suiting of words of Scripture to them, is to insinuate some thoughts against the doctrine of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> is not questionable; especially being the worke of him, that makes it his businesse to oppose it, and laugh it to scorne. With what successe this attempt is mannaged, a little consideration of what is offered will evince. It is true, <hi>Paul</hi> sayes to <hi>us, there is one God:</hi> treating of the vanity and nothingnesse of the Idols of the Heathen, whom God hath threatned to <hi>deprive</hi> of all worship, and to starve out of the world. The Question as here proposed, <hi>how many Gods of Christians are there,</hi> having no such occasion administred unto it; as that expression of <hi>Paul,</hi> being no parcell of such a discourse, as he insists upon, sounds pleasantly towards the allowance of <hi>many Gods,</hi> though Christians have but one. Neither is M. B. so averse to <hi>Polutheisme,</hi> as not to give occasion (on other accounts) to this supposal. Jesus Christ he allowes to be a God.

                  <hi>are we Baptized,</hi> whom we serve, who to us, is the one God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all. Neither is that Assertion, of the Fathers being the one, and only true God, any more prejudiciall to the Sonnes being so also, then that Testimony given to the everlasting Deity of the Son, is to that of the Father, notwithstanding that to us there is but one God.

               </p>
               <p>That we may not mistake his mind, &amp; intention in this Query, some light may be taken from some other passages in his booke. In the preface he tells you: <hi>that God hath a similitude and shape,</hi> (of which afterwards) &amp; hath his <hi>place</hi> in the Heavens. That <hi>God is in no certain place,</hi> he reckons amongst those errors he opposesin the same Preface. Of the same kind he asserteth the beliefe to be, of <hi>Gods being infinite, &amp; incōprehensible:</hi> &amp; <hi>Cat. les. p. 6. That God glistereth with Glory, &amp; is resident in a certaine place of the Heavens, so that one may distinguish between his right and left hand by bodily sight.</hi> This is the Doctrine of the man, with whom we have to do, concerning the Presence of God. <hi>He is</hi> (saith he) <hi>in Heaven, as in a certaine place;</hi> That which is in a certaine place, is <hi>finite,</hi> and limited; as from the nature of a place, and the manner of any things being in a place, shall be instantly evinced. God then is finite, and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, be it so: (that he is infinite and incomprehensible is yet Scripture Expression) yea he is so limited, as not to be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to the the whole compasse, and limit of the Heavens; but he is in a <hi>certaine place of the Heavens,</hi> yea so circumscribed, as that a man may see from his <hi>right hand to his left:</hi> wherein M. B. comes short of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who affirmes, that when he was taken into Heaven, to the sight of God, he found <hi>three dayes journey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his eye-browes,</hi> which if so, it will be somewhat hard, for any one to see from his right hand to his left, being supposed at an answerable distance to that of his eye-browes. Let us see then on what Testimony, by what Authority, M. B. doth here li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Almighty, and confine him to a certaine place, shutting up his Essence and being, in some certaine part of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, cutting him thereby short, as we shall see in the issue, in all those eternall perfections, whereby hitherto he hath been knowne to the sonnes of men.</p>
               <p>The proofe of that lyes in the places of Scripture, which making mention of God, say, <hi>He is in Heaven, and that He looketh downe from</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 11.</note>
                  <hi>Heaven, &amp;c.</hi> Of which out of some <hi>Concordance,</hi> some 20, or 30. are by him repeated. Not to make long worke of a short businesse; The Scriptures say, God is <hi>in Heaven;</hi> who ever denyed it? But do the Scriptures say he is no where else? Do the Scriptures say he is confined to Heaven, so that he is so there, as not to be in all
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115372:66"/> other places? If M. B. thinks this any argument, <hi>God is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> therefore <hi>his Essence is not Infinite,</hi> and <hi>immense,</hi> therefore He is not every where, we are not of his mind. He tells you in his <hi>Preface, that He asserts nothing himselfe:</hi> I presume his Reason was, least any should call upon him for a proofe of his Assertions. What he intends to insinuate, &amp; what conceptions of God he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to insnare the <hi>minds</hi> of <hi>unlearned,</hi> &amp; <hi>unstable soules</hi> withall, in this question under consideration, hath been from the evidence of his intendment therein, and the concurrent Testimony of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expressions of his to the same purpose, demonstrated. To propose any thing directly, in way of proofe of the truth of that which he labours insensibly to draw the minds of men unto, He was (doubtlesse) conscious to himselfe of so much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability for its performance, as to wave that kind of procedure. And therefore his whole endeavour is, having filled, animated, and Spirited, the understandings of men, with the notion cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in his Question, to cast in some Scripture expressions, that as they lye, may seeme fitted, to the fixing of the notion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore begotten in them. As to any attempt of direct proofe of what he would have confirmed, the <hi>man of Reason</hi> is utterly silent.</p>
               <p n="2">2. None of those Texts of Scripture, where mention is made of Gods being in Heaven, are in the coherence, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> of speech, wherein they lye, suited, or intended at all, to give answer to this Question, or any like it, concerning the <hi>Presence of God,</hi> or his actuall existence in any place, but only in respect of some dispensations of God, and workes of his, whose fountaine and originall he would have us to consider in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and to come forth from him there, where in an eminent manner he manifests his Glory. God is I say in none of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by him urged, said to be <hi>in Heaven,</hi> in respect of his Essence or being, nor is it the intention of the Holy Ghost, in any of them, to declare the manner of Gods Essentiall presence, and existence, in reference to all, or any places; but only by the way of eminency, in respect of manifestations of himselfe, and operations from his glorious presence, doth he so speak of him. And indeed in those expressions, <hi>Heaven,</hi> doth not so much signify a <hi>place,</hi> as a <hi>thing,</hi> or at least a <hi>place,</hi> in reference ot the <hi>things</hi> there done, or the peculiar manifestations of the Glory
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:115372:67"/> of God there; so that if these places should be made use of, as to the proofe of the figment insinuated, the Argument from them would be, <hi>â non causâ pro causâ.</hi> The reason why God is said to be <hi>in Heaven,</hi> is not because his Essence is included in a certaine place, so called, but because of the more eminent manifestation of his Glory there, and the regard which he requires to be had of him, manifesting his Glory, as the first cause, and Author of all the workes, which outwardly are of him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God is said to be in Heaven in an especiall manner, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> he hath assigned that as the place of the Saints expectation of that enjoyment of eternall fruition of himselfe, which he hath promised to blesse them withall. But for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting of his essence to a certaine place in Heaven, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as we shall see, know nothing, yea expressly, and positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirme the contrary.</p>
               <p>Let all then supply our catechamens, in the Rome of M. B's, with this Question, expressly leading to the things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> after.</p>

               <p>Ans. <hi>The Lord your God, he is God in Heaven above, and in earth beneath Josh.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold the Heavens, and Heaven of Heavens cannot containe thee, how much lesse the House that I have builded. 1 Kings 8. 27.</hi>

                  <hi>Whither shall I goe from thy Spirit, or whither shall I flee from thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence?

               <p>
                  <hi>Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God, afarre of, can any hide himselfe in secret places, that I shall not see him, saith the Lord, do not I fill Heaven and Earth saith the Lord? Jerem.</hi> 23. 24.</p>
               <p>It is of the <hi>ubiquity and omnipresence</hi> of God, that these places <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> expresly treat; and whereas i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was manifested before, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Gods being in Heaven, doth not at all speak to the abomination, which M. B. would insinuate thereby, the naked rehearsall of those Testimonies, so directly asserting, and ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:115372:67"/> to the Almighty, an Infinite, Unlimited Presence, and that in direct opposition, to the grosse apprehension of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined to a certain place in Heaven, is abundantly suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, to deliver the thoughts, and minds of men, from any entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glements that M. B's Questions and Answers (for though it be the word of the Scripture he insists upon, yet, <hi>male dum recitas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit esse tnum</hi>) might lead them into. On that account no more need be added: but yet this occasion being administred, that Truth it selfe, concerning the <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> or <hi>Ʋbiquity</hi> of God, may be farther cleared, and confirmed.</p>
               <p>Through the prejudices and ignorances of men, it is enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whether God be so present in any certain place, as not to <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> be also equally elsewhere, every where.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Place</hi> has been commonly defined to be, <hi>superficies corporis am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bientis;</hi> Because of sundry inextricable difficulties, and impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of suiting it to every place, this definition is now gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally decryed. That now commonly received, is more naturall, suited to the Natures of things, and obvious to the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. A place, is, <hi>spatium corporis susceptivum;</hi> any space wherein a body may be received, and contained. The first consideration of it, is, as to its <hi>fitnesse</hi> and <hi>aptnesse,</hi> so to receive any body: so it is in the imagination only. The second, as to its <hi>actuall existence,</hi> being filled with that body, which it is apt to receive. So may we imagine innumerable spaces in Heaven, which are apt, and able to receive the bodies of the Saints; and which actually shall be <hi>filled</hi> with them, when they shall be translated thereinto, by the power of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Presence in a place,</hi> is the actuall existence of a person in its <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> place: or as Logicians speak, in its <hi>Ʋbi;</hi> that is, answering the enquiry after him, where he is. Though all bodies are in certain places, yet Persons only, are said to be present in them; other things have not properly a presence to be ascribed to them: They are <hi>in</hi> their proper places, but we doe not say, they are <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in,</hi> or <hi>to</hi> their places. This being the generall description of a place, and the presence of any therein, it is evident, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly it cannot be spoken at all of God, that he is in one place or other; for he is not a body, that should fill up the space of its receipt; nor yet in all places, taking the word properly, for so one Essence can be but in one place; and if the word should
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:115372:68"/> properly be ascribed to God in any sence, it would deprive him of all his infinite Perfections.</p>
               <p>It is farther said, that there be three wayes of the Presence of any, in reference to a place, or places; some are so in a place, as <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> to be <hi>circumscribed</hi> therein, in respect of their parts, and dimensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such is their length, breadth, and depth, so doth one part of them fit one part of the place wherein they are, and the whole the whole, so are all solid bodies in a place; so is a man, his whole body in his whole place, his head in one part of it, his armes in another: some are so conceived to be in a place, as that in relation to it, it may be said of them, that they are there in it, so as not to be any where else, though they have not parts, and dimensions filling the place wherein they are, nor are punctually <hi>circumscribed</hi> with a locall space; such is the presence of <hi>Angells,</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> to the places wherein they are, being not <hi>infinite</hi> or <hi>immense;</hi> These are so in some certain place, as not to be at the same time, wherein they are so, without it, or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, or in any other place: And this is proper to all finite, immateriall substances, that are so in a place, as not to occupy and fill up that space wherein they are. In respect of <hi>place,</hi> God is <hi>immense,</hi> and <hi>indistant</hi> to all things, and places, absent from nothing, no place, contained in none; present to all, by and in his infinite Essence, and Being, exerting his power variously, in any, or all places, as he pleaseth, revealing and manifesting his Glory, more or lesse, as it seemeth good to him.</p>
               <p>Of this Omnipresence of God, two things are usually enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after. 1. The thing it selfe, or the Demonstration, that he <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> is so <hi>Omnipresent.</hi> 2. The manner of it, or the Manifestation, and declaring <hi>how</hi> he is so present. Of this latter perhaps sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry things have been over curiously, and nicely, by some dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: though upon a through search, their disputes may not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare altogether uselesse. The Schoolemens distinctions of Gods being in a place, <hi>repletivè, immensivè, impletivè, superexcedentèr, conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vativè, attinctivè, manifestative, &amp;c.</hi> Have, some of them at least, foundation in the Scriptures, and right Reason. That which seemes most obnoxious to exception, is their assertion, of God to be every where present, <hi>instar puncti:</hi> but the sence of that, and its intendment, is to expresse, how God is <hi>not</hi> in a place, rather then how he is. He is not in a place as <hi>quantative</hi> bodyes, that have
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:115372:68"/> the <hi>dimensions</hi> attending them: Neither could his presence in Heaven, by those who shut Him up there, be any otherwise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, untill they were relieved by the rare notions of M. B. concerning the distinct places of <hi>His right hand and left.</hi> But it is not at all about the manner of Gods presence, that I am occasioned to speake, but only of the thing it selfe. They who say, He is in Heaven only, speake as to the thing, and not as to the manner of it; When we say, <hi>He is every where,</hi> our Assertion is also to be interpreted, as to <hi>that</hi> only; The <hi>manner</hi> of His Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence being purely of a Philosophicall consideration: His <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> it selfe divinely revealed, and necessarily attending his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections; Yea it is an Essentiall property of God. The propertyes of God, are either <hi>absolute, or relative.</hi> The absolute propertyes of God are such, as may be considered, without the supposition of any thing else whatever, towards which their <hi>energy,</hi> and efficacy should be exerted. His relative are such, as in their <hi>egresse</hi> and <hi>exercise,</hi> respect some things in the Creatures, though they naturally and eternally reside in God. Of the first sort is Gods <hi>Immensity;</hi> it is an absolute property of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Being; for God to be <hi>immense, infinite, unbounded, unlimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> is as necessary to him, as to be God; that is, it is of his Essentiall perfection, so to be. The <hi>Ʋbiquity</hi> of God, or his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence to all things, and persons, is a relative property of God; for to say, that God is present in, and to all things, supposes those things to be. Indeed the Ubiquity of God, is the <hi>Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of his Immensity to the Creation; supposing the Creatures, the world that is, God is by reason of his Immensity, <hi>indist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> to them all: or if more worlds be supposed, (as all things possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the power of God, without any absurdity may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed) on the same account as he is Omnipresent, in reference to the present world, he would be so to them &amp; all that is in them.</p>
               <p>Of that which we affirme in this matter, this is the summe; <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> God, who in his own being and Essence is Infinite and Immense, is by reason thereof, present in, and to the whole Creation, equally, not by a diffusion of his substance, or mixture with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, Heaven or Earth; in, or upon them, but by an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable indistancy</hi> of Essence to all things, though he exert his power, and manifest his Glory, in one place more then another: as in <hi>Heaven,</hi> in <hi>Sion,</hi> at the <hi>Arke, &amp;c.</hi>

In that 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8. 27. the designe of <hi>Solomon</hi> in the words, gives light to the substance of what he asserted, he had newly with labour, cost, charge, and wisdome, none of them to be parallel'd in the world, built a <hi>Temple</hi> for the worship of God; The house being large, and exceedingly glorious, the apprehensions of all the Nations round about, (that looked on, and considered the worke he had in hand,) concerning the Nature, and Being of God, being grosse, carnall, and superstititous, themselves an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerably, worshipping those, <hi>who by nature were not God,</hi> &amp; his own people of Israel, exceedingly prone to the same abominations, least any should suppose, that he had thoughts of including the <hi>Essence of God</hi> in the house that he had bulit; he cleares himselfe in this confession of his Faith, from all such imaginations; affirming that though indeed God would <hi>dwell</hi> on the Earth, yet he was so farre from being limited unto, or circumscribed in the House that he had built, that the <hi>Heavens, even the Heaven of Heavens,</hi> any space whatever that could be imagined, the highest Heavens, could not, cannot containe Him, so far is he from having a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place in Heaven, where he should reside, in distinction from other places, where he is not; <hi>He is God in Heaven, and in Earth, Josh.</hi> 2. 11. That which the Temple of God was bulit unto, that the Heaven &amp; the Heaven of Heavens cannot containe: Now the Temple was built to the <hi>Being of God,</hi> to <hi>God as God.</hi> so <hi>Acts. 7. 47.

And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Essence is necessarily so: this is a consequence that none can deny, who will consider it, till he understands the termes of it, as hath been declared.

If <hi>equall,</hi> the <hi>whole</hi> is equall to the <hi>part;</hi> if lesse, then that halfe is <hi>limited</hi> within certaine
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115372:76"/> bounds: and consequently is <hi>finite,</hi> and so is the other halfe also: Therefore two things which are <hi>finite</hi> shall make up an <hi>Infinite;</hi> which is a contradiction.</p>
               <p>Having therefore proved out of Scripture, that God is <hi>Infinite,</hi> it followes also, that he is <hi>Incorporeall,</hi> &amp; that he is without <hi>Shape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former Argument proved him to be without such a <hi>shape,</hi> as this Catechist would Insinuate: <hi>this,</hi> that he <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> is without any shape at all. The same will be proved from the <hi>Immutability</hi> or <hi>impassibility</hi> of Gods Essence, which the Scripture assignes to him. <hi>Mal. 3. 6. I am the Lord I change not. The Heavens are the worke of thy hand, they shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, but thou endurest, they shall be changed, but thou art the same Psal.</hi> 102. 26.</p>
               <p>If he be <hi>immutable,</hi> then he is also <hi>incorporeall,</hi> and consequently without <hi>Shape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The former consequence is manifest, for every body is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,</hi> and consequently is capable of <hi>division,</hi> which is <hi>mutation;</hi> wherefore being <hi>immutable</hi> he hath no <hi>Shape.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>M. <hi>Biddle's</hi> great plea for the considering his Catechisme, &amp; insisting upon the same way of inquiry with himselfe, is from <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> the successe, which himselfe hath found in the discovery of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Truths, of which he gives an account in his booke, to the Reader. That among the glorious discoveries made by him, the particular now insisted on is not to be reckoned, I presume M. B. knoweth For this discovery, the world is beholding to one <hi>Audaeus</hi> a Monke, of whom you have a large account in <hi>Epiphanius Tom. 1. lib. 3. Haeres.</hi> 70. as also in <hi>Theodoret. lib. 4. Ecles.

He that thinks it worth while to know, that we are not beholding to M. B. but to this <hi>Audaeus</hi> for all the Arguments, whither taken from the creation of man in the Image of God, or the attibution of the parts and members of a man unto God in the Scripture, to prove him to have a visible Shape, may at his leasure consult the Authors above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, who will not suffer him to ascribe the praise of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to M.

               <p>For the vindication of Gods <hi>fore-knowledge,</hi> I shall proceed in <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> the same order as before, in reference to the other Attributes of God, insisted on: <hi>viz.</hi> 1. What M. B. hath done, how he hath disposed of sundry places of Scripture for the proofe of his as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, with the sence of the places, by him so produced, is to be considered. 2. Another Question and Answer is to be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:115372:83"/> supplied in the roomeof his. 3. The Truth vindicated, to be farther confirmed.</p>
               <p>For the First.</p>
               <p>In the proofe of the Assertion proposed, Mr B. finds himselfe entangled more then ordinarily; though I confesse his taske in <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> generall be such, as no man, not made desperate by the losse of all, in a <hi>shipwrack</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> would once have undertaken. To have made good his proceeding according to his ingagement, he was at least to have given us Texts of Scripture, expresse in the letter, as by him cut off from the state, condition, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>erence, wherein by the Holy Ghost they are placed, for the countenancing of his assertion. But here, being not able to make any work in his method proposed, and boasted in, as sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and uncontroleable; no <hi>apex,</hi> or tittle in the Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pointed towards the deniall of Gods knowing any thing, or all things, <hi>past, present,</hi> &amp; <hi>to come:</hi> He moulds his Question into a peculiar fashion, and askes, <hi>whence,</hi> or from <hi>what place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may</hi> such a thing as he there averrs, <hi>be gathered?</hi> At once plainly declining the triall he had put himselfe upon, of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting upon expresse Texts of Scripture only; not one, of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny quoted by him, speaking one word expressly to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in hand, and laying himselfe naked to all consequences, rightly deduced from the Scripture, and expositions, given to the letter of some places, suitable to the <note n="e" place="margin">Rom. 12. 6.</note>
                  <hi>proportion of Faith.</hi> That then which he would have, he tells you, is <hi>gathered</hi> from the places of Scripture subjoyned; but <hi>how,</hi> by <hi>whom,</hi> by what <hi>consequence,</hi> with what evidence of Reason, it is so <hi>gathered,</hi> he tells you not. An understanding indeed informed with such grosse conceptions of the nature of the Deity, as M. B. hath la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to insinuate into the minds of men, might <hi>gather</hi> from his collection of places of Scripture for his purpose in hand, that God is <hi>afraid, troubled, grieved,</hi> that he <hi>repenteth, altereth,</hi> and <hi>changeth</hi> his mind to and fro; but of his <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>sore-knowledge</hi> of things, whether he have any such thing or not, there is not the least intimation; unlesse it be in this, that if he had any such fore-knowledge, he need not put himselfe to so much trouble and vexation, nor so change, and alter his mind, as he doth. And with such figments as these, (through the Infinite, Wise, and good Providence of God, punishing the wantonnesse of the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:115372:83"/> minds, and lives of men, by <note n="f" place="margin">2 Thess. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note>
                  <hi>giving them up to strong delusurs,</hi> and vaine Imaginations, in the darknes of their foolish hearts, so far, <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 1. 23.</note> as to change <hi>the glory of the incorruptible God,</hi> into the likenesse of a corruptible, weak, ignorant, sinfull man) are we now to deale.</p>
               <p>But let the places themselves be considered. To these heads <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> they may be referred, (1.) such as ascribe unto God <hi>feare, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afraid. Deut. 32. 26, 27. Exod. 13. 17. Gen. 3. 22. 23.</hi> are of this sort. (2.) <hi>Repentance: 1 Sam. 15. 10, 11, ult. (3.) Change, or alteration of mind: Numb. 14. 27, 30. 1 Sam. 2. 30. (4.) Expectation,</hi> whether a thing will answer his desire or no: <hi>Isa. 5. 4. Conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Jerem. 36. 1, 2, 3. Ezek. 12. 1, 2. (5.) Trying of experiments, Judg. 3. 1, 4. Dan. 8. 2. 2 Chron.</hi> 32. 31. From all which and the like, it may, by M. B's direction and helpe, be thus gathered: <hi>If God be afraid of what is to come to passe, and repenteth him of what he hath done, when he finds it not to answer his expectation, if he sits divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and onjecturing at events, being often deceived therein, and therefore tryes and makes experiments, that he may be enformed of the true state of things, then certainely he knowes not the free actions of men, that are not yet come to passe.</hi> The Antecedent M. B. hath proved undeniably from ten texts of Scripture; and doubtlesse the consequent is easily to be gathered by any of his Disciples. Doubtlesse it is high time, that the old musty <hi>Catechisms</hi> or prejudicate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, who scarce so much as once consulted with the Scripture in their composures, as being more engaged into factions, were removed out of the way, and burned, that this <hi>meere Christian,</hi> may have liberty to blesse the growing Generation, with such notions of God, as the <hi>Idolatrous Pagans</hi> of old, would have scorned to have received.</p>
               <p>But doe not the Scriptures ascribe all the particulars mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> unto God? Can you blame M. <hi>Biddle</hi> without reflection on them? If only what the Scripture affirmes in the letter, and not the sence wherein, and the manner how it affirmes it, (which considerations are allowed to all the writings, and speakings of the sonnes of men,) is to be considered, the End seeming to be aimed at in such undertakings, as this of M. B. namely, to induce the Atheistical spirits of the sonnes of men, to a contempt and scorne of them, and their Authority, will probably be sooner attained, then by the efficacy of any one engine raised against them in the worldbesides.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:115372:84"/>
               <p>As to the matter under consideration; I have some few things in <hi>generall</hi> to propose to M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> and then I shall descend to the <hi>particulars</hi> insisted on.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then, I desire to know whether the things mentioned, as <hi>Feare, Griefe,</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">Paenitentia infert igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantiam praeteriti, praesentis, &amp; futuri, mutationem volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis, &amp; errorem in consiliis, quorum nihil in Deum cadere potest: dicitur tamen ille me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphorice penitentiâ duci, quemadmodum nos, quando a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licujus rei paenitet, abolemus, id quod antea feceramus: quod fieri potest sine tali mutatione voluntatis, quâ nunc homo aliquid facit, quod post mutato animo, destruit. <hi>Manasseh Ben.

                  <hi>Repentance, Trouble, Conjecturings, making trialls</hi> of men for his owne information, are ascribed <hi>properly</hi> to God, as they are unto men, or <hi>tropically</hi> and figuratively, with a condescention to us, to expresse the things spoken of, and not to describe the nature of God? If the first be said, namely, that these things are ascribed properly to God, and really signify of him, the things in us intended in them, then to what hath been spoken in the consideration taken of the foregoing Querie, I shall freely adde, for mine owne part, I will not own, nor worship him for my God, who is <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> affraid what all the men in the world either will, or can do; who doth, can do, or hath done any thing, or suffered any thing to be done, of which he doth, or can truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>repent</hi> himselfe, with sorrow and griefe for his mistake; or that sits in Heaven <hi>divining,</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecturing</hi> at what men will doe here below: and do know, that He whom <hi>I serve in my spirit, will famish and starve all such Gods out of the world.</hi> But of this before. If these things are ascribed to God <hi>figuratively,</hi> &amp; <hi>improperly,</hi> discovering the kind of his workes, and dispensations, not his own <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Propertyes;</hi> I would faine know what inference can be made, or conclusion be drawn from such expressions, directly calling for a <hi>figurative interpretation?</hi> For instance, if God be said to <hi>repent</hi> that he had done such a thing, because such and such things are come to passe thereupon, if this <hi>Repentance</hi> in God, be not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ascribed to him (as by M.

                  <hi>scre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeth not the free actions of men?</hi> And this is the Issue of M. <hi>Biddles</hi> confirmation of the <hi>Thesis,</hi> couched in his Query insisted on, from the Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:115372:84"/>2. I must crave leave once more to mind him of the Rule <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> he hath given us in his Preface, <hi>viz</hi> That where <hi>a thing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ascribed to God, in some other place it is denyed of him;</hi> as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in that of his being <hi>weary:</hi> so that what ever is denyed of him in any one place, is not properly ascribed to him in any other. Now, though God be said in some of the places by him produced, to repent; yet it is in another expressly said, that he doth not do so, and that upon such a generall ground and Reason, as is equally exclusive of all those other <hi>passions,</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> upon whose assignement unto God, the whole strength of M. <hi>Biddles</hi> plea against the Prescience of God doth depend. 1 <hi>Sam. 15. 29. Also the strength of Israell will not lye, no repent, for he is not a man that he should repent.</hi> The immutability of his nature, &amp; unlikenesse to men in obnoxiousnesse to alterations, is asserted as the reason of his not repenting; which will equally extend its force and efficacy, to the removall from him, of all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>humane affections</hi> mentioned. And this second generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the foundation of M. B's plea, is sufficient: for the removall of the whole.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I desire to know, whether indeed it is only the <hi>free acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men that are not yet done,</hi> that M. B. denyes to be knowne of <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> God? Or whether he exclude him not also from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>present state,</hi> frame and actings of the hearts of men, and how they stand affected towards him: being therein like other Rulers among men, who may judge of the good &amp; evill actions of men, so farre as they are manifest and evident, but how men in their hearts stand affected to them, their Rule Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment, and Authority, they know not. To make this enquiry, I have not only the observation premised, from the words of the close of M. <hi>Biddles</hi> Query, being of a negative importance, (<hi>yea that there are such actions</hi>) but also from some of the proofes by him produced, of his former assertion, being interpreted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>literiall significancy</hi> of the words, as exclusive of any figure, which he insisteth on. Of this sort is that of <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 12, 10, 11, 12. <note n="i" place="margin">Ex hac acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one propter quam ab omnibus Deum timens vocaberis cognoscent omnes, quantus in to sit timor Dei, &amp; quous{que} pertingat. <hi>R.

                  </note> where God is said to <hi>tempt Abraham,</hi> and upon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:115372:85"/> the Issue of that tryall sayes to him, (which words M. <hi>B.</hi> by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in a different character, points to, as comrehensive of what he intends to gather, &amp; conclude from them) <hi>NOW I KNOW that thou fearest God, seeing thou hast not with-held thy sonne, thine only sonne from me.</hi> The collection which M. B. guides unto from hence, is, <hi>that God knew not that which he enquired after,</hi> and therefore <hi>tempted Abraham</hi> that he might so do, and upon the issue of that tryall saies, <hi>now I know.</hi> But what was it that God affirmes, that now he knew? Not any thing future; not any free action, that was not as yet done; but something of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent condition and frame of his heart towards God: <hi>viz. His feare of God;</hi> not whether he <hi>would feare</hi> him, but whether he <hi>did feare</hi> him then. If this then be properly spoken of God, &amp; really, as to the nature of the thing it selfe, then is he ignorant no lesse of things present, then of those that are for to come. He knowes now who <hi>feares</hi> him, nor who <hi>hates</hi> him, unlesse he have opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to try them, in some such way as he did <hi>Abraham:</hi> And then what a God hath this man delineated to us? How like the dunghil Deities of the Heathen who speake after this rate. <note n="k" place="margin">Contigerat nostras infamia temporis aures; Quam cupiens falsam summo dilabor Olympo, Et Deus humanâ lustro sub imagine terras. <hi>Ovid.</hi>
                  </note> Doubtlesse the description that <hi>Elijah</hi> gave of <hi>Baal,</hi> would better suite him, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those divine Perfections, which the living, alseeing God, hath described himselfe by. But now if M. B. will confesse, that God knowes all the things that are present, &amp; that this enquiry after the present frame of the heart and spirit of a man, is improperly ascribed to him, from the <hi>Analogy</hi> of his proceedings in his dealings with him, to that which we insist upon, when we would really finde out what we doe not know; then I would only aske of him, why those other expressons which he mentions, looking to what is to come, being of the same nature &amp; kind with this, doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of yea call for the same kind of exposition and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Neither is this the only place insisted on by M. <hi>B.</hi> where the <note place="margin">§. 11.</note>
                  <hi>inquiries</hi> ascribed unto God, &amp; the tyall that he makes, is not in reference to <hi>things to come,</hi> but punctually to what is present. <hi>Deut. 8. 2. chap. 13. 3. The Lord your God proveth you, to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soule.</hi>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:115372:85"/> 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 31. God left him to try him, that he might know what was in his heart;</hi> and <hi>Phil. 4. 6. In every thing let your request be made know to God.</hi> Let M. <hi>Biddle</hi> tell us now plainely, whether he suppose all these things to be spoken properly of God, and that indeed God <hi>knowes not our hearts,</hi> the frame of them, nor what in them we desire and aime at, without some eminent tryall &amp; inquiry, or untill we our selves do make knowne what is in them unto him. If this be the mans mind (as it must be, if he be at any agreement with himselfe in his principles, concerning these scripturall Attributions unto God,) for my part, I shall be so farre from esteeming him eminent, as a <hi>meere Christian,</hi> that I shall scarcely judge him comparable, as to his apprehensions of God, unto many that lived and dyed <hi>meere Pagans.</hi> To this sence also is applyed that Property of God, that he <hi>tryeth the hearts,</hi> as it is urged by M. <hi>Biddle</hi> from 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 4, that is, he maketh inquiry after what is in them, which but upon search and tryall, he knoweth not. By what wayes and meanes God accomplisheth this search, and whether hereupon he comes to a perfect understanding of our hearts, or no, is not expressed. <hi>John</hi> tells us, that <hi>God is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things;</hi> and we have thought on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, (with that of such farther discoveryes as he hath made of himselfe, and his Perfections unto us) that he had been said to search our hearts, not that himselfe, for his own information, needs any such formall processe by way of tryall and enquiry, but because really and indeed he doth that in himselfe, which men aime at in the accomplishment of their most diligent searches, and exactest tryalls.</p>
               <p>And we may by the way see a little of this mans consistency with himselfe. Christ he denyes to be God. A great part of <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> his Religion consists in that negative. Yet of Christ it is said, <hi>that he knew all men, and needed not that any should testifyin of man, for he knew what was inman, John 2. 24, 25.</hi> and this is spoken in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to that very thing in the hearts of men, which he would perswade us, that God knowes not without inquiry. That is, upon the account of his not <hi>committing</hi> himselfe to those, as true Believers, whom yet upon the account of the profession they made, the Scripture calls so, and sayes, <hi>they believed in his name when they saw the miracels that he did, v.</hi> 23. Though they had such
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:115372:86"/> a vaile of profession upon them, that the Holy Ghost would have us esteeme them as Believers, yet Christ could looke through it, into their hearts, and discover &amp; know their frame, and whether in sincerity they loved him, and believed in his name or no; but this God cannot do, without enquiry and yet Christ (if we believe M. B.) was but a <hi>meere man,</hi> as he is a <hi>meere Christian.</hi> Further, it seemes by this Gentleman, that unlesse <hi>we make knowne our requests to God;</hi> he knowes not what we will aske. Yet we aske nothing but what is in our thoughts: and in the last querie he instructs us, that God knowes our thoughts, and doubtlesse knowes M. <hi>Biddles</hi> to be but folly. Further yet, if God must be concluded <hi>ignorant</hi> of our desires, because we are bid to <hi>make our requests,</hi> knowne to him, He may be as well concluded <hi>forgetfull</hi> of what himselfe hath spoken, because he bids us, <hi>put him in remembrance,</hi> and appoints some to be his <hi>Remembrancers:</hi> But to returne.</p>
               <p>This is the aspect of almost one halfe of the places produced <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> by M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> towards the businesse in hand; if they are properly spoken of God, in the same sence as they are of man; they conclude him not to know <hi>things present,</hi> the frame of the heart of any man in the world towards himselfe, and his feare, nay the outward, open, notorious actions of men.

                  <hi>Crellius,</hi> one of M. <hi>B's</hi> great Masters. <hi>I will goe downe and see</hi> (or know) <hi>whether they have done altogether according to the cry that is come up unto me.</hi> Yea the places which in their letter &amp; outward appearance seeme to ascribe that ignorance of <hi>things present</hi> unto God, are farre more expresse and numerous, then those that in the least looke forward to what is yet for to <hi>come,</hi> or was so, at their delivery. This progresse then have we made under our <hi>Catechist,</hi> if we may believe him, as he insinvates his notions concerning God: God, <hi>sits in Heaven (glistering on a throne)</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he is limited, yea to a <hi>certaine place</hi> therein, so as not to be elsewhere, being <hi>grieved, troubled,</hi> and <hi>perplexed,</hi> at the <hi>affaires</hi> done below which he doth know, making inquiry after what he doth not know,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:115372:86"/> and many things, (<hi>things future</hi>) he knoweth not at all.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to the farther Consideration of that which <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> is eminently, and expressly denyed by M. <hi>Biddle. viz. Gods fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of our free actions that are future,</hi> because many of his proofes, in the sence by him urged, seeme to exclude him from an acquaintance with many <hi>things present,</hi> as in particular, <hi>the frame and condition of the hearts men,</hi> towards himselfe, as was observed; it may not be amisse, a little to confirme that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the knowledge of God as to those things, from the Scripture, which will abundantly also manifest, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions insisted on by our <hi>Catechist,</hi> are <hi>metaphoricall,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ascribed to God. Of the eminent predictions in the Scripture, which relate unto things future, I shall speake af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. He knew, for he foretold the <hi>Flood,</hi> the destruction of <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> the <hi>Famine</hi> in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> the selling and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of <hi>Joseph.</hi> the Raigne of <hi>David,</hi> the division of his Kingdome, the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity, the Kingdome of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the returne of his people, the state and ruine of the foure great <hi>Empires</hi> of the world, the Warres, Plagues, Famines, Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, Divisions, which he manifestly foretold. But far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he knowes the frame of the hearts of men. He knew that the <hi>Keilites</hi> would deliver up <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul</hi> if he staid amongst them, which probably they knew not themselves, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. He knew that <hi>Hazael</hi> would murther women and infants, which he knew not himselfe. He knew that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> would afflict his People, though at first they entertained them with Honour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 13. He knew <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he would instruct his houshold. <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. 19. He knew that some were obstinate, their neck an iron sinew, and their brow brasse <hi>Isa.</hi> 48. 4. He knew the imagination, or figment of the heart of his People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 21. That the Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> (notwithstanding her profession) was lukewarme, neither hot nor cold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 15. Man looketh on the outward appearance, <hi>God looketh on the heart, 1 Sam. 16. 7. He only knowes the hearts of all the children of men, 1 Kings 8. 39. Hell and destruction are before the Lord, how much more then the hearts of the Sonnes of men. Prov. 15. 11.</hi> so also <hi>Prov. 24. 12. Jerem. 1. 9, 10. Ezek. 11. 5. Ps. 38. 9. Psal. 94. 11.

               <p n="3">3. The sole foundation of M. <hi>Biddles</hi> insinuation, that <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> God knowes not our <hi>free actions that are future,</hi> being laid (as was observed,) on the assignation of <hi>Feare, Repentance, Expectation,</hi> &amp; <hi>Conjecturing</hi> unto God, the consideration which hath already been had of those Attributions in the Scripture, and the causes of them, is abundanly sufficient to remove it out of the way, and to let his inference sinke thither, whence it came. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse never was painter so injurious to the Deity, who limned out the shape of an <hi>old man</hi> on a cloth or board, and after some disputes with himselfe, whether he should sell it for an emblem of winter, and then set it out as a representaton of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as this man is, in snatching Gods own pencil out of his hand, &amp; by it presenting him to the world in a grosse, carnall, deformed shape. <hi>Plato</hi> would not suffer <hi>Homer</hi> in his Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, for entrenching upon the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary blessedness of their dunghill Deities; making <note n="a" place="margin">Hom: Iliad: Rhapsod. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Q. <hi>Doth not God know all things, whether past, present, or to come, all the wayes, and actions of men, even before their accomplishment, or is any thing hid from him? What saies the Scripture properly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly hereunto?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>God is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things, 1 John 3. 20. Neither is there any Creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked, and open to the eyes of him, with whom we have to do. Heb. 4. 12. He is a God of knowledge, 1 Sam. 2. 3. Thou knowest my downsitting, and mine uprising, thou understandest my thoughts a farre off. Thou compassest my paths, and my lying downe, and art acquainted with all my wayes, for there is not a word in my tongue but O Lord thou knowest it altogether: Psal. 139. 2, 3, 4, 5. Great is our Lord, and of great power his understanding is Infinite, Psal.</hi> 141. 5. Who hath <hi>directed the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord,</hi> or being his Councellour hath taught him? With whom tooke he Councell, or who instructed him, and taught him in the paths of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding? <hi>Isa. 40. 13, 14. There is no searching of his understanding v. 28. Ro.</hi> 11. 34, 35, 36. of him are all things; And <hi>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the World,</hi> Act. 15. 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Of the Undeniable evidence and conviction of Gods <hi>Prescience</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> or <hi>Foreknowledge</hi> of future contingents, from His predictions of their comming to pass, with other demonstrations of the Truth under consideration, attended with their several testimonies from Scripture, the close of this discourse will give a further Account.</p>
               <p>It remaines only, that according to the way and method formerly insisted on, I give some farther Account of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God pleaded for, with the Arguments wherewith it is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:115372:88"/> farther evidenced to us, and so to proceed to what followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>Knowledge</hi> is proper to God, that testimony of the <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> Scripture unto the excellency and perfection of the thing it selfe, doth sufficiently evince. <note n="o" place="margin">Intellectio secundum se e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus est, quod se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundum se op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timum est. <hi>Julius Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nellus l. 3. c. 4 ex Arist.

                  </note> I cannot tell (saies the Apostle) <hi>God knoweth 2 Cor.</hi> 12. 2, 3. It is the Generall voice of Nature, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on relation of any thing that to us is hid, and unknowne, that the Apostle there makes mention of; GOD KNOWETH. That he knowes the things that are past, M. <hi>B.</hi> doth not question. That at least also somethings that are present, yea some thoughts of our hearts are known to him, eh doth not deny. It is not my intendment to engage in any curious Scholasticall discourse about the <hi>understanding, science, knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Wisdome</hi> of God; nor of the way of Gods knowing things, in, and by, his own Essence through simple intuition. That which directly is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, is his knowledg of our <hi>free actions,</hi> which in respect of their second &amp; immediate caudses, may, or may not be. This therefore I shall briefly explain, and confirme the truth of it, by Scripture Testimonyes, and Arguments from right Reason, not to be evaded, without making head against all Gods infinite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; having already demonstrated, that all that which is insisted on by M. <hi>B.</hi> to oppose it, is spoken metaphorically, and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly to God.</p>

Had they not sometimes been <hi>future,</hi> they had never been. What ever <hi>is, was</hi> to be, before it was. All things that <hi>shall be</hi> to the end of the world are now <hi>future.</hi> How things which were only <hi>possible</hi> in relation to the power of God, come to be <hi>future,</hi> and in what respect, shall be briefely mentioned. These things God knoweth also. His science of them is called, of <hi>vision.</hi> He sees them, as things which in their proper order shall exist. In a word, <hi>Scientia Visionis,</hi> and <hi>Simplicis Intelligentiae,</hi> may be considered in a threefold relation; that is, in <hi>ordine ad objectum, mensuram, modum. 1. Scientia Visionis</hi> hath for its object things past, present, and to come, whatsoever had, hath, or will have actuall being. 2. The measure of this knowledge is his will: because he will, &amp; decree of God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make those things future, which were but possible be fore, therefore we say <hi>scientia visionis fundatur in voluntate.</hi> 3. For the manner of it, it is called <hi>scientia libera, quia fundatur in voluntate,</hi> as necessarily presupposing a free act of the divine will, which makes things future, and so objects of this kind of knowledge. 2. That <hi>scientia,</hi> which we call <hi>simplicis intelligentiae;</hi> the object of it is, <hi>possible,</hi> the measure of it, <hi>Omnipotency;</hi> for by it he knowes all he can do; &amp; for the manner of it, 'tis <hi>scientia necessaria, quia non fundatur in voluntate, sed potestate;</hi> (say the Schoolemen) seeing by it he knowes not what he will, but what he can do. Of that late figment, of a <hi>middle science</hi> in God, arising neither from the <hi>infinite Perfection</hi> of his own being, as that of simple intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, nor yet attending his free purpose and decree, as that of Vision, but from a consideration of the second causes that are to produce the things fore known, in their kind, order, and dependance, I am not now to treat. And with the former kind of knowledge it is, or rather in the former way, (the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God being simply one and the same) is it, that we affirme him to know the things that are future, of what sort soever, or all things before they come to passe.</p>

               <p>Some previous observations will make way for the cleare <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> proofe and demonstration of this truth. Then</p>
               <p n="1">1. God certainly knowes every thing that is to be known: that is, every thing that is <hi>scibile.</hi> If there be in the nature of things an <hi>impossibility</hi> to be known, they cannot be known by the <hi>divine understanding.</hi> If any thing be <hi>scibile,</hi> or may be known, the not knowing of it, is his <hi>imperfection</hi> if he knowes it nor. To God this cannot be ascribed, (<hi>viz.</hi> that he should not know what is to be known) without the destruction of his Perfection. He shall not be my God, who is not infinitely! Perfect. He who
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:115372:90"/> wants any thing to make him blessed in himselfe, can never make the fruition of himselfe the blessednesse of others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Every thing that hath <hi>a determinate cause</hi> is <hi>scibile,</hi> may be <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> known, though future, by him that perfectly knowes that cause, which doth so determine the thing to be knwn unto existence. Now <hi>Contingem</hi> things, the <hi>free</hi> Actions of men, that yet are not, but in respect of themselves may or may not be, have such a <hi>determinate cause</hi> of their existence, as that mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. It is true, in respect of their <hi>immediate causes,</hi> as the wills of men, they are <hi>contingent,</hi> and may be, or not be; but that they have such a cause as before spoken of, is evident from the light of this consideration. In their own time and order they are: now what ever is at any time, was future; before it was, it was to be. If it had not been future, it had not now been. Its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent existence is sufficient demonstration of the futurition it had before. I aske then, whence it came to be <hi>future;</hi> that that action was rather to be, then a thousand others, that were as possible as it? For instance, that the <hi>side of Christ should be pierced with a speare,</hi> when it was as possible in the nature of the thing it selfe, and of all secundary causes, that his head should be cut off. That then which gives any action a <hi>futurition,</hi> is that determinate cause wherein it may be known, whereof we speake. Thus it may be said of the same thing, that it is <hi>contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,</hi> and <hi>determined,</hi> without the least appearance of contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, because it is not spoken with respect to the same things, or causes.</p>

Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. 1. Quaest. 83. Art. 1. ad 3.</note> more free or contingent. God is not a necessary Agent, as to any of the workes, that outwardly are of him: whence then did God know this? Was it not from his own decree, and eternall purpose, that such a world there should be? And if the knowledge of one contingent thing be from hence, why not of all? In briefe, these future contingencyes depend on something for their existence, or they come forth into the world in their own strength and upon their own account, not depending on any other. If the latter, they are God; if the former, the will of God, or old fortune, must be the Principle on which they do depend.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

In saying they are <hi>things future</hi> and contingent, you grant them to be among the number of things; as you do those which you call things past: But that <hi>God knowes all things,</hi> hath allready been abundantly confirmed out of Scriptures. Let the Reader looke back on some of the many texts and places, by which I gave answer to the Querie, about the Fore-knowledge of God, and he will find abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough for his satisfaction, if he be of those that would be satisfied, and dares not carelessly make bold to trample upon the Perfections of God. Take some few of them to a review. 1 <hi>John 3. 20. God is greater then our hearts, and knoweth all things.</hi> Even we know things past and present: If God knoes only things of the same kind, his knowledge may be greater then ours by <hi>many degrees,</hi> but you cannot say his understanding is infinite; there is not on that supposition an <hi>infinite</hi> distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his knowledge and ours, but they stand in some mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surable proportion. <hi>Heb. 4. 13. All things are open and naked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him with whom we have to do.</hi> Not that which is to <hi>come,</hi> not the <hi>free actions</hi> of men that are future, saith M. <hi>Biddle.</hi> But to distinguish thus, when the Scripture doth not distinguish, and
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:115372:92"/> that to the great dishonour of God, is not to interpret the Word, but to deny it. <hi>Acts 15. 18. Known unto God are all his workes from the foundation of the world.</hi> I aske, whether God hath any thing to do in the free actions of men? For instance, had he any thing to do in the sending of <hi>Joseph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> his exaltation there, and the entertainment of his Fathers houshold afterwards by him in his greatnesse and power? All which were brought about by innumerable contingencyes, and free actions of men: if he had not, why should we any longer depend on him, or regard him in the severall transactions, &amp; concernements of our lives?</p>

               <p>If he had to do with it, as <hi>Joseph</hi> thought he had, when he affirmed plainely, <hi>that God sent him thither, and made him a Father to Pharaoh, and his house,</hi> then the whole was known to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; <note place="margin">Gen. 45. 5, 6, 7, 8.</note> for <hi>known unto God are all his workes from the foundation of the world.</hi> And if God may know any one free action before hand, he may know all; for there is the same reason of them all. Their contingency is given as the only cause, why they may not be known; now every action that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent, is equally interested therein: <hi>a quatenus ad omne valet argumentum.</hi> That place of the <hi>Psalme</hi> before recited <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. is expresse, as to the knowledge of God concerning our free actions, that are yet future. If any thing in the world may be reckoned amongst our free actions, surely our <hi>thoughts</hi> may: and such a close reserved treasure are they, that M.

But these (saith the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist,) <hi>God knowes afarre off,</hi> before we think them; before they enter into our hearts. And truly I marvell, that any man, not wholly given up to a <hi>spirit of giddinesse,</hi> after he had produced this Text of Scripture, to prove that God knowes our thoughts, should instantly subjoyne a Question, leading men to a perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, that God knowes not our free actions, that are future: unlesse it was with a <hi>Julian</hi> designe, to impaire the credit of the Word of God, by pretending it lyable to selfe-contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; or with <hi>Lucian</hi> to deride God, as bearing contrary Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies concerning himselfe.</p>

There need no great search or inquiry after witnesses to confirme the truth of it; the Scripture is full of such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> from one end to the other: some few instances shall suffice: <hi>Gen. 18. 18, 19. Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty Nation, and all the Nations of the earth shall be blessed in him; For I know him, that he will command his Children, and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do Justice and Judgment; that the Lord may bring upon upon Abraham, that which he hath spoken of him.</hi> Scarce a word but is expressive of some future contingent thing, if the free actions of men be so, before they are wrought. That <hi>Abraham</hi> should become a <hi>mighty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> that the nations of the Earth should be <hi>Blessed in him:</hi> that he would command his Children, and houshold after him to keepe the wayes of the Lord; it was all to be brought about by the free actions of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and of others; and all this I know saith the Lord, and accordingly declares it. By the way, if the Lord knew all this before, his following tryall of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was not to satisfy himselfe whether he feared him or no, as is pretended.</p>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:115372:93"/>
               <p>So also <hi>Gen. 15. 13, 14. And he said unto Abraham, know of a surety</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 32.</note>
                  <hi>that they seed shall be a stranger in a Land that is not theirs, and they shall serve them, and they shall afflict them foure hundred yeares: And also that Nation which they shall seive will I Judge: and they shall come out with great substance.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> affliction on the <hi>Israelites</hi> was by their free actions, if any be free: It was their sin to do it: they sinned in all that they did for the effecting of it. And doubtlesse if any, mens sinfull actions are free; yet these doth God here fore tell; they shall afflict them.</p>

                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 16, 17, 18. you have an instance beyond all possible <note place="margin">§. 33.</note> exception. <hi>And the Lord said unto Moses, behold thou shalt s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

The peoples going a <hi>whoring</hi> after the Gods of the strangers of the Land; their forsaking of God, their breaking his Covenant, the thoughts of their hearts, &amp; their expressions, upon the consideration of the evills and afflictions that should befall them, were of their free actions: but now all these doth God here <hi>foretell;</hi> and thereby engages the honour of his Truth, unto the certainty of their comming to passe.</p>

Did <hi>Josiah</hi> act freely? Was his proceeding at <hi>Bethel</hi> by free actions, or no? If not, how shall we know what actions of men are free, what not?

               <p n="1">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 28. The Prophet-<hi>Micaiah</hi> in the name <note place="margin">§. 35.</note> of the Lord, having fore told a thing that was contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, and which was accomplished by a man acting at a
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:115372:94"/> venture, lays the credit of his Prophesy, and therein his life, (For if he had proved false as to the event, he was to have suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death by the Law,) at stake before all the people, upon the certainty of the Issue fore-told. <hi>And Micaiah said, if then returne at all in peace, the Lord hath not spoken at all by me. And he said, heare all yee people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of these predictions the Scripture is full. The Prophesyes of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Isaiah;</hi> of the issue of the <hi>Babylonish Warre,</hi> and <hi>Kingdome,</hi> in <hi>Jeremiah;</hi> of the severall great alterations and changes in the Empires of the world, in <hi>Daniel,</hi> of the Kingdome of Christ in them all, are too long to be insisted on. The Reader may also consult <hi>Math. 24. 5. Mark, 13. 6. Mark. 14. 30. Act. 20. 29. 2 Thes. 2. 3, 4. &amp;c. 1 Tim. 4. 1. 2 Tim. 3. 1. 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 1. And the <hi>Revelation</hi> almost throughout. Our first proposition then is undenyably evident, that God by <hi>himselfe,</hi> and by his <hi>Prophets,</hi> hath fore-told things <hi>future,</hi> even the free-actions of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The second Proposition mentioned is manifest, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in its own Light. What God fore-telleth, that he perfectly <note place="margin">§. 36.</note> fore-knowes. The honour and repute of his Veracity, and Truth, yea of his Being, depend on the certaine accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what he absolutely fore-tells. If his predictions of things future are not bottomed on his certaine Prescience of them, they are all but like <hi>Sathans Oracles,</hi> conjectures, and guesses of what may be accomplished or not; a supposition whereof, is as high a pitch of blasphemy as any creature in this world can possibly arrive unto.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By this Prerogative of certaine predictions, in reference <note place="margin">§. 37.</note> to things to come, God vindicates his own Deity; and from the want of it convinces the vanity of the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the falsenesse of the Prophets that pretend to speake in his name. <hi>Isa. 41. 21, 22, 23, 24. Produce your cause, saith the Lord, bring forth, your strong Reasons, saith the King of Jacob: let them bring then forth, and shew us what shall happen, let them shew the former things what they be, or delare us things for to come: Show the things which are to cme hereafter, that we may know ye are Gods. Behold you are of nothing.</hi> The Lord calling forth the Idols of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Divels, Stocks, and Stones, to plead for themselves, before the denuntiation of the solemne sentence ensuing, <hi>v.</hi> 24. He puts them to the plea of <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> for the proofe of their Deity. If they can
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:115372:94"/> fore-tell things to come certainely and infallibly, on the account of their own knowledge of them, Gods they are, and Gods they shall be esteemed. If not (saith he) you <hi>are nothing, worse then nothing,</hi> and your worke is of nought, and he is an <hi>Abomination that chuseth you.</hi> And it may particularly be remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that the Idolls, of whom he speaketh, are in especiall those of the <hi>Caldeans,</hi> whose worshippers pretended above all men in the world to Divination, and Predictions. Now this issue doth the Lord drive things to betwixt himselfe, and the Idolls of the world; If they can fore-tell things to come, that is, not this, or that thing, (for so by conjecture, upon considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of second causes, and the generall dispositions of things, they may do, and the Divell hath one) but any thing, or every thing, they shall go free, that is, is there nothing hid from you that is yet for to be? Being not able to stand before this interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, they perish before the Judgment mentioned. But now if it may be replyed to the <hi>Living God</hi> himselfe, that this is a most une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall way of proceeding, to lay that burthen upon the shoulders of others, which himselfe will not beare; bring others to that tryall, which himselfe cannot undergoe, for he himselfe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fore-tell the free-actions of men, because he doth not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know them, would not his plea render him like to the Idolls, whom he adjudgeth to shame and confusion? God himselfe there concluding, that they are vanity and nothing, who are pretended to be Gods, but are not able to fore-tell the things that are for to come, asserts his own Deity, upon the account of his Infinite Understanding, and Knowledge of all things, on the account whereof he can foreshew all things whatever, that are as yet future. In like manner doth he proceed to evince what is from himselfe, what not, in the Predictions of any, from the certainty of the event. <hi>Deut. 18. 21, 22. If thou say in thine heart, how shall we know the word that the Lord hath not spoken, when a Prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to passe, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken, but the Prophet hath spoken presumptuously, thou shalt not be afraid of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth Proposition, that God by the free actions of men (some whereof he fore telleth,) doth fulfill his own <note place="margin">§. 38.</note> counsell as to Judgements, and Mercyes, Rewards, and Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:115372:95"/> needs no farther proofe nor confirmation, but what will arise from a meere review of the things before mentioned, by God so foretold, as was to be proved. They were things of the greatest import in the World, as to the good or evill of the inhabitants thereof; &amp; in whose accomplishment as much of the Wisdome, Power, Righteousnesse, and Mercy of God was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, as in any of the workes of his Providence what ever. Those things which he hath disposed of, as to be subservient to so great ends, certainly he knew that they would be. The selling of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the crucyfying of his Son, the destruction of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> are things of greater concernment, then that God should only conjecture at their event. And indeed the taking away of Gods <hi>fore-knowledge</hi> of things contingent, renders his Providence uselesse, as to the government of the World. To what end should any <hi>rely</hi> upon him, seek unto him, commit themselves to his care through the course of their lives, when he knows not what will, or may befall them the next day? How shall he Judg, or rule the world, who every moment is surprized with new emergencyes, which he foresaw not, which must necessitate him to new counsells and determinations? On the consideration of this Argument doth <hi>Episcopius</hi> conclude for the Prescience of God, <hi>Epist. 2. ad Beverovicium de termino vitae,</hi> which he had allowed to be questioned in his <note n="c" place="margin">Speciem &amp; pondus videtur habere haec ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectia; nec pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci sunt, qui ejus, vi adeo moventur, ut divinam futurorum contingentium praescientiam negart, &amp; quae pro eâ facere videntur loca, at{que} Argumenta, magno conatu torquere malint, &amp; flectere in sensus, non minus periculos s quam difficiles.

               <p>Those things which God foretells, that they shall certainly and infallibly come to passe; before they so doe, those he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and infallibly knoweth, whilest they are future, and that they will come to passe.</p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:115372:95"/>
               <p>But God foretells, and hath foretold all manner of future contingencies, and free Actions of men, good and evill, duties, and sinnes, therefore he certainly and infallibly knowes them, whilest they are yet future.</p>
               <p>The Proposition stands and falls unto the honour of Gods Truth, Veracity, and Power.</p>
               <p>The Assumption is proved by the former, and sundry other instances that may be given.</p>
               <p>He foretold, that the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> should afflict his People 400 yeares, that in so doing they would sin, and that for it he would punish them, <hi>Gen:</hi> 15. 13, 14, 15, 16. And surely the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> sinning therein, was their own free action. The incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> treachery of <hi>Judas,</hi> calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> all that happened to Christ in the daies of his flesh, the coming of Antichrist, the rise of false teachers, were all fore-told, and did all of them purely depend on the free actions of men: which was to be demonstrated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To omit many other Arguments, and to close this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; <note place="margin">§. 39.</note> All perfections are to be ascribed to God, they are all in him. To <hi>know</hi> is an excellency: He that knowes any thing, is therein better then he that knowes it not. The more any one knowes, the more excellent is he. To <hi>know all things</hi> is an absolute perfection in the good of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: to know them in, and by himselfe, who so knowes them, &amp; not from any discourses, made to him from without, is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute perfection in it selfe, and is required where there is Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Wisdome and Understanding. This we ascribe to God, as worthy of him, as by himselfe ascribed to himselfe. To affirme on the other side (1.) That God hath his knowledge from things without him, and so is taught Wisdome and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, as we are, from the events of things, for the more any one knowes the wiser he is. (2.) That he hath (as we have) a successive knowledge of things, knowing that one day, which he knew not another, and that thereupon there is (3.) A daily and hourely change, and alterati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115372:96"/> them, to shut his Providence out of the World, and to devest him of all his Blessednesse, selfe sufficiency, and infinite Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And in deed if M. B. believe his own principles, and would speake out, he must assert these things, how desperate soever; for having granted the premises, 'tis stupidity to stick at the conclusion. And therefore some of those whom M. B. is pleased to follow in these wild vagaries, speake out, and say, (though with as much blasphemy as confidence) that God doth only conjecture, and guesse at future contingents. For when this Argument is brought, <hi>Gen. 18. 19. I know</hi> (saith God) <hi>Abraham will command his Children after him, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore future contingents may be certainly known of him. They deny the <note n="a" place="margin">Anonymus ad 5. cap. priora Math. p. 28. <hi>Nego consequentiam Deus dicere potuit se scire quid facturus erat Abraham, etsi id certo non praenoverit, sed probabiliter.

               <p>Before I close this discourse, it may not be impertinent to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert <note place="margin">§. 44.</note> a little to that, which alone seemes to be of any difficulty, lying in our way, in the assertion of this Prescience of God, though no occasion of its consideration be administred to us by him, with whom we have to do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That future contingents have not in themselves a determinate truth, and therefore cannot be determinately known,</hi> is the great plea of those, who oppose Gods certaine Fore-knowledge of them: and therefore say they, doth the <note n="e" place="margin">Arist. 1. de Inter p. c. 8.</note> Philosopher affirme, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions concerning them, are neither true nor false. But</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is, or may be, that there hath been, a certaine prediction of <hi>future contingents,</hi> hath been demonstrated, and therefore they must on some account or other, (and what that account is hath been declared) have a determinate Truth. And I had much rather conclude, that there are certaine <hi>predictions</hi> of <hi>future contingents</hi> in the Scripture, and therefore they have a determinate truth: Then on the contrary, they have no deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Truth, therefore there are no certaine predictions of them: <hi>Let God be true, and every man a lyer.</hi>

As to the falsity of that pretended <hi>Axiome:</hi> This propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, Such a Souldier shall pierce the side of Christ, with a Speare, or he shall not pierce him, is determinately true, and necessary, on the one side or the other, the parts of it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory, which cannot be together. Therefore if a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood had used this Proposition in the affirmative, it had been certainely and determinately true; for that Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which was once not true, cannot be true afterward upon the same account.</p>

                  <p>HAving delivered his thoughts concerning God Himselfe, His Nature, and Propertyes, in the foregoing Chapters; <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> in this our Catechist proceeds to the consideration of his <hi>Workes,</hi> ascribing to God the <hi>Creation</hi> of all things, especially insisting on the making of man. Now although many questions might be proposed, from which M, B. would (I suppose) be scarcely able to extricate himselfe, relating to the impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the proceeding of such a <hi>Worke,</hi> as the Creation of all things, from such an <hi>Agent</hi> as he hath described God to be, so <hi>limited</hi> both in his Essence and Propertyes; Yet, it being no part of my businesse, to dispute, or perplexe any thing, that is simply in its selfe true, and unquestionable, with the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencyes of it from other corrupt notions of him, or them, by whom it is received, and proposed, I shall wholly omit all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations of that nature, and apply my selfe meerly to what is by him expressed. That He who is <hi>limited</hi> &amp; <hi>finite in Essence,</hi> and consequently in <hi>Propertyes,</hi> should by his power, without the helpe of any intervening instrument, out of nothing produce, at such a vast distance from him, as his hands can by no meanes reach unto, such mighty effects, as the earth it selfe, and the fulnesse thereof, is not of an easy proofe or resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But on these things at present I shall not insist: Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that on this apprehension of God, the <note n="a" place="margin">Quibus e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim oculis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tueri potue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit vester Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fabricam il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam tanti operis, quâ construia Deo &amp; aedificari mundum faecit?

                  <p>Right! only in the Exposition of this verse, as it discovers the principall efficient cause of the Creation of all things, or the Author of this great worke, M.

By (<hi>God</hi>) he intends the <hi>Father</hi> only, and exclusively; the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plentifully ascribing this Worke also to the <hi>Sonne,</hi> and Holy Ghost, manifesting their concurrence in the indivisible Deity unto this great worke; though by the way of <hi>Eminency,</hi> this worke be attributed to the Father, as that of Redemption is to the Sonne, and that of Regeneration to the Holy Ghost; from neither of which notwithstanding is the Father exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>

But what a sad successe this <hi>Demiurgus</hi> had, by his want of <hi>Prescience,</hi> or fore-sight of what his <hi>Daemons</hi> would do, (wherein also M. <hi>Biddle</hi> likens God unto him) is farther declared: for they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently, causing a conflux of too much <hi>matter and humour,</hi> no small tumult followed thereon in Heaven, as at large you may see in the same Author. However, it is said expressly the <hi>Son</hi> or <hi>Word created all things, John 1. 3. and by him are all things, 1 Cor. 8. 6. Revel.</hi> 4. 11. Of the Holy Ghost the same is affirmed, <hi>Gen. 1. 2. Job. 26. 13. Psal.</hi> 33. 6. Nor can the Word and Spirit be degraded from the place of Principall efficient cause in this Worke, to a condition of <hi>instrumentallity</hi> only, which is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, (especially in reference to the Spirit) unlesse we shall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them to have been created before any creation, and to have been instrumentall of their own production. But of these things in their proper place.</p>
                  <p>Q. His second question is, <hi>How long was God a making them?</hi> And he answers from <hi>Exod. 20. 11. In six dayes the Lord made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 4.</note>

                  </p>
                  <p>The rule formerly I prescribed to my selfe of dealing with M. B. causes me to passe this Question also, without farther inquiry; although having already considered what his notions are, concerning the Nature and Propertyes of God, I can scarse avoid conjecturing, that by this crude proposall of the <hi>Time,</hi> wherein the worke of Gods Creation was finished, there is an intendment, to insinuate such a grosse conception of the working of God, as will by no meanes be suited to his omnipotent production of all things. But speaking of things no farther then enforced, I shall not insist on this Query.</p>
                  <p>Q. His third is, <hi>How did God Create man?</hi> And the Answer is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. To which he adds a fourth, <hi>How did He Create Woman?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> which he resolves from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 21, 22.</p>
                  <p>M. <hi>Biddle</hi> undertaking to give all <hi>the grounds of Religion</hi> in his <hi>Catechismes,</hi> teacheth as well by his <hi>silence</hi> as his <hi>expressions.</hi> What he mentions not in the known Doctrine he opposeth, he may well be interpreted to reject. As to the matter <hi>whereof Man</hi> and <hi>Woman</hi> were made, M. <hi>Biddles</hi> Answers do expresse it; but as to
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:115372:99"/> the condition and state, <hi>wherein</hi> they were made, that he is silent; though he knowes the Scripture doth much more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in delivering the one then the other. Neither can his silence in this thing be imputed to oversight, or forgetfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, considering how subservient it is to his intendment, in his two last questions, for the subverting of the Doctrine of <hi>Originel sinne,</hi> and the denyall of all those effects, and cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>quents of the first breach of Covenant, whereof he speakes. He can upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account take notice, that man was made in the <hi>Image of God.</hi> But whereas hitherto Christians have supposed, that that denoted some <hi>Spirituall perfection</hi> bestowed on man, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he resembles God, M. B. hath discovered, that it is only an expression of some <hi>imperfection of God,</hi> wherein he resembles man: which yet he will as hardly perswade us of, as that a man hath <hi>seven eyes,</hi> or <hi>two wings,</hi> which are ascribed unto God also. That man was created in a resemblance and likenesse un-God, in that immortall substance <hi>breathed</hi> into his nostrills, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 7. in the excellent rationall faculties thereof; the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion he was intrusted withall over a great part of Gods Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, but especially in the integrity and <hi>uprightnesse</hi> of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 29. wherein he stood before God, in reference to the obedience required at his hands; which condition, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting of new <hi>qualities</hi> in our soule, we are through Christ in some measure <hi>renewed</hi> unto, <hi>Coll.</hi> 3. 10, 12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is cleare, evident, and full in the discovery of; but hereof M. B. conceives not himselfe bound to take notice. But what is farther needfull to be spoken, as to the state of man before the Fall, will fall under the consideration of the last Question of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>M. B's proces in the following questions, is to expres the story <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> of mans outward condition, unto the eighth, where he enquires after the Commandement given of God, to man, when he put him into the Garden, in these words.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What commandement gave he to the man, when he put him into the Garden?</hi> This he resolves from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 16, 17. That God gave our first Parents the command expressed, is undeniable. That the matter chiefely expressed in that command, was all, or the principall part of what he required of them, M B. doth not go about to prove. I shall only desire to know of him, whether
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:115372:99"/> God did not in that estate require of them, that they should <hi>love him, feare him, believe him, acknowledge</hi> their dependance on him, in universall obedience to his will? And whether a sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenesse unto all this duty, were not wrought within them by God? If he shall say no, and that God required no more of them, but only <hi>not to eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evill;</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know, whether they might have <hi>hated</hi> God, <hi>abhorred</hi> him, <hi>believed</hi> Sathan, and yet been free from the threatning here mentioned, if they had only forbore the outward eating of the fruit? If this shall be granted, I hope I need not insist to manifest what will easily be inferred? Nor to shew how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible this is, <note n="e" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Diatrib. de Juslit. Vindicat.</note> God continuing God, and man a rationall creature? If he shall say, that certainly God did require, that they should <hi>own</hi> him for God, that is, <hi>believe</hi> him, <hi>love</hi> him, <hi>feare</hi> him, and worship him, according to all that he should reveale to them, and require of them, I desire to know, whether this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular command, could be any other then <hi>Sacramentall,</hi> and <hi>Symbolicall,</hi> as to the matter of it, being a thing of so small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>importance in its own nature, in comparison of those morall acknowledgements of God before mentioned. And to that question I shall not need to adde more.</p>
                  <p>Although it may justly be supposed, that M. B. is not without <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> some thoughts of deviation from the truth, in the following Questions, yet the last being of most importance, and he being express therein, in denying all the effects of the first sinne, but only the Curse that came upon the outward visible World, I shall insist only on that, and close our considerations of this Chapter. His question is thus proposed.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Did the sinne of our first Parents in eating of the forbidden fruit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 8.</note>
                     <hi>bring both upon them, and their posterity, the guilt of hell fire, deface the Image of God in them, darken their understandings, enslave their wills, deprive them of Power to do good, and cause mortality? If not, what are the true penalties denounced against them for that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this he answers from <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 16, 17, 18, 19.</p>
                  <p>What the sinne of our first Parents was, may easily be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> from what was said before, concerning the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement given to them. If universall obedience was required of them unto God, according to the tenour of the law of their
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:115372:100"/> Creation, their sinne was an universall Rebellion against, and Apostacy from him; which though it expressed it selfe, in the peculiar transgression of that command mentioned, yet it is farre from being reducible to any one kind of sinne, whole whole nature is comprised in that expression. Of the effects of this sinne, commonly assigned, M. B. annumerates, and rejects <hi>Six:</hi> sundry whereof are coincident, and all but one, redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible to that generall head of losse of the image of God. But for the exclusion of them all at once from being any effects of the first sinne, M. <hi>Biddle</hi> thus argues; <hi>If there were no effects, not consequences of the first sinne, but what are expressly mentioned Gen.</hi> 3. 16, 17. <hi>&amp;c. then those now mentioned are no effects of it; but there are no effects, or consequences of that first sinne, but what are mentioned in that place; therefore those recounted in his Querie, and commonly esteemed such, are to be cashired from any such place in the thoughts of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The words insisted on by M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> being expressive of the Curse of God for sinne, on man, and the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here below for his sake, it will not be easy for him to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, that none of the things he rejects, are not eminently en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped in them. Would God have denounced, and actually inflicted such a Curse on the whole Creation, which he had put in subjection to man, as well as upon man himselfe, and actually have inflicted it with so much dread, and severity, as he hath done, if the Transgression upon the account whereof he did it, had not been as universall a rebellion against him, as could be fallen into? Man fell in his whole dependance from God, and is cursed universally in all his concernments, Spirituall and Temporall.</p>
                  <p>But is this indeed the <hi>only</hi> place of Scripture, where the effects <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> of our Apostacy from God, in the sinne of our first Parents, are described? M. <hi>Biddle</hi> may as well tell us, that <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. is the only place, where mention is made of Jesus Christ; for there he is mentioned. But a little to cleare this whole matter in our passage, though what hath been spoken may suffice, to make naked M. B's Sophistry.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the effects of the first sinne, we understand every thing <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> of evill, that either within, or without, in respect of a present, or future condition, in reference to God, and the fruition of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:115372:100"/> Him, whereto man was created, or the enjoyment of any good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness from God, which is come upon mankind, by the just or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination &amp; appointment of God, whereunto man was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious in his <hi>Primitive</hi> state and condition. I am not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at all engaged to speak <hi>de modo,</hi> of what is <hi>privative,</hi> what <hi>positive</hi> in originall sinne, of the way of the Traduction, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of it, of the imputation of the guilt of the first sinne, and adhesion of the pollution of our nature, defiled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, or any other questions, that are coincident with these, in the usuall <hi>inquest</hi> made into, and after the sinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> and the fruits of it, but only as to the things themselves, which are here wholly denyed. Now</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That what soever is evill in man by nature, whatever he is obnoxious and lyable unto, that is hurtfull, and destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> to him, and all men in common, in reference to the end whereto they were created, or any Title wherewith they were at first intrusted, is all wholly the effect of the first sinne, and is <hi>in solidum</hi> to be ascribed thereunto, is easily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That which is common to all things in any kind, and is proper to them only of that kind, must needs have some <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> common cause equally respecting the whole kind: but now of the evills that are common to all mankind, and peculiar, or proper to them, and every one of them, there can be no cause, but that which equally concernes them all, which by the Testimony of God himselfe, was this fall of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, Rom.</hi> 5. 15, 18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The evills that are now incumbent upon men in their Naturall condition, (which what they are, shall be afterward <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> considered) were either incumbent on them at their first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, before the sinne and fall of our first Parents, or they are come upon them since, through some interposing cause, or occasion. That they were not in them, on them, that they were not liable, nor obnoxious to those evills, which are now incumbent on them, in their first Creation, as they came forth from the hand of God, (besides what was said before, of the state and condition wherein man was Created, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the sight of God, in his favour and Aceptation, no way obnoxious to his anger and wrath,) is evident, by the light of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:115372:101"/> this one consideration, <hi>viz.</hi> That there was nothing in man, nor belonging to him, no Respect, no Regard, or Relation, but what was purely, and immediately of the holy Gods cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and institution. Now it is contrary to all that he hath revealed, or made known to us of himselfe, that he should be the immediate Author of so much evill, as is now by his own Testimony in man by nature, and without any Occasion, of so much vanity, and misery as he is subject unto: and besides, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly thwarting the Testimony which he gave of all the Workes of his hands, that they <hi>were exceeding good:</hi> it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that man in the condition whereof we speake, is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding evill.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If all the evill mentioned, hath since befallen mankind, <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> then it hath done so by some chance and Accident, whereof God was not aware, or by his righteous Judgment and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, in reference to some procuring, and justly deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Cause of such a punishment. To affirme the first, is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter to deny him to be God: And I doubt not, but that men, at as easy and cheape a rate of sinne, may deny that there is a God, as confessing his Divine Essence, to turne it into an Idol; and by <hi>making thick clouds,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> speakes, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose between him &amp; the affaires of the World, to exclude his Energeticall Providence in the disposall of all the workes of his hands. If the latter be affirmed, I aske as before, what other common cause, wherein all and every one of mankind is equally concerned, can be assigned of the evills mentioned, as the procurement of the Wrath and Vengeance of God, from whence they are, but only the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> the sinne of <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 18.</note> our first Parents; especially considering, that the Holy Ghost doth so expressly point out this fountain, and sourse of the evills insisted on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. These things then being premised, it will quickly appeare, <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> that every one of the particulars, rejected by M. B. from being fruits or effects of the first sinne, are indeed the proper issues of it: and though M. B. cut the <hi>Roll</hi> of the Abominations, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Nature of man by sinne, <hi>and cast it into the fire,</hi> yet we may easily <hi>write</hi> it againe, and <hi>adde many more Words</hi> of the like importance.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first Effect or fruit of the first sinne, rejected by <hi>M. B.</hi>

Wherefore as by one man sinne en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into the world, and death by sinne, and so death passed on all men for that all have sinned.</hi> That all men sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> that they contracted the guilt of the same death with him, that death <hi>entred by sinne,</hi> the holy Ghost is expresse in. The death here mentioned is, that which God threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> if he did transgresse, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. which that it was not death Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall only, yea not at all, M. B. contends, by denying <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity</hi> to be a fruit of this sinne: as also excluding in this very Query all roome for death spirituall, which consists in the defacing of the Image of God in us, which he with this rejects; And what death remaines, but that which hath <hi>Hell</hi> following after it, we shall afterwards consider.</p>
                  <p>Besides, that death which Christ dyed to deliver us from, <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> was that which we were obnoxious to, upon the account of the first sinne: for he came to <hi>save that which was lost: and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted death to deliver us from death; dying to deliver them, who for feare of death were in bondage all their lives, Heb.</hi> 2, 13. But that this was such a death, as hath <hi>Hell-fire</hi> attending it, he manifests, by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming, that he <hi>delivers us from the wrath to come;</hi> By <hi>Hell fire</hi> we understand nothing but the wrath of God for sinne, into <hi>whose hand it is a fearefull thing to fall,</hi> our God being a consuming fire. That the guilt of every sinne is this <hi>death</hi> whereof we speake, that hath both Curse and Wrath attending it, and that it is the proper wages of sinne, the Testimony of God is evident. <note place="margin">Rom. 6. 13.</note> What other death men are obnoxious to, on the account of the first sinne, that hath not these concomitants, M. B. hath not as yet revealed. By nature also we are <hi>children of wrath;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 2. 3.</note> and on what foot of account our obnoxiousnesse now by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture unto wrath is to be stated, is sufficiently evident by the light of the preceding considerations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The defacing of the Image of God in us,</hi> by this sinne, as it is usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally asserted, is in the next place denyed. That man was <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> created in the <hi>Image of God,</hi> and wherein that image of God doth consist, was before declared. That we are now borne with that Character upon us, as it was at first enstamped upon us, must be affirmed, or some common cause of the defect,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:115372:102"/> that is in us, wherein all and every one of the posterity of <hi>Adam</hi> are equally concerned, besides that of the first sinne, is to be assigned. That this <hi>latter</hi> cannot be done, hath been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy declared. He that shall undertake to make good the <hi>former,</hi> must engage in a more difficult worke, then M. B. in the midst of his other employments, is willing to undertake. To in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on all particulars relating to the <hi>Image</hi> of God in man, how farre it is defaced, whether any thing properly and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereunto belonging, be yet left remaining in us; to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare how farre our soules, in respect of their immortall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, faculties, and Consciences, our <hi>Persons,</hi> in respect of that dominion over the Creatures, which yet by Gods gracious and mercifull Providence we retaine, may be said to bare the Image of God, is a worke of another nature, then what I am now engaged in. For the asserting of what is here denyed by M. B. concerning the defacing of the Image of God in us by sinne, no more is required, but only the tender of some demonstrations to the maine of our intendment in the Asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, touching the <hi>losse</hi> by the <hi>first sin,</hi> &amp; our present want in the state of nature, of that Righteousnesse and Holinesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man at his first Creation stood before God, (in reference un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the End whereunto he was Created,) in uprightnesse, and ability of walking unto all well pleasing. And as this will be fully manifested in the consideration of the ensuing parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars instanced in by M. B. so it is sufficiently cleare and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, from the renovation of that Image, which we have by Jesus Christ, &amp; that expressed both in generall, &amp; in all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein we affirme that image to be defaced. <hi>The new man, which we put on in Jesus Christ, which is renewed in knowledge, after the image of Him that treated him, Coll.</hi> 3. 10. is that which we want, by sinnes defacing (<hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o more</hi>) of that Image of God in us, which we had in knowledge; so <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 23, 24. That new man is said to consist in the <hi>Renewing</hi> of our mind, whereby after God we are Created in Righteousnesse and Holinesse. So that whereas we were created in the <hi>image of God,</hi> in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse and Holinesse, and are to be renewed again by Christ, unto the same condition of his Image in Righteousnesse and Holinesse, we doubt not to affirme, that by the first same
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:115372:102"/> (the only interposition, of generall concernement to all the sons of men,) the Image of God in us was exceedingly defaced. In summe, that which made us sinners, brought sinne and death upon us, that which made us lyable to condemnation, that defaced the image of God in us; that all this was done by the first sinne, the Apostle plainly asserts, <hi>Rom. 5, 12, 15, 17, 18, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the next particular effect of sinne, by M. B. rejected, (the <hi>darkning of our under standings,</hi>) I shall only enquire of him, whether <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> God made us at first with our <hi>understandings darke,</hi> and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as to those things which are of absolute necessity that we should be acquainted withall, for the attainment of the End whereunto he made us? For once, I will suppose he will not affirme it; and shall therefore proceed one stop farther, and aske him; whether there be not such a darkenesse now upon us by nature, opposed unto that light, that spirituall and saving Knowledge, which is of absolute necessity for every one to have, and be furnished withall, that will againe attaine that glory of God, which we are borne short of: Now because this is that which will most probably be denyed, I shall by the way only desire him.</p>

                  <p>Of the <hi>enslaving of our wills, and the depriving us of power to do good,</hi> there is the same Reason, as of that next before. It is <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> not my purpose to handle the <hi>common place</hi> of the corruption of
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:115372:103"/> nature by sinne; nor can I say, that it is well for M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> that he finds none of those effects of sinne in himselfe; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The last thing denyed is, its <hi>causing Mortallity.</hi> God threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> man with death if he sinned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 17. seems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct us, that if he had not sinned, he should not have dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And upon his sinne, affirming, that on that account he should be dissolved, and returne to his dust, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 18, 19. no lesse evidently convinces us, that his sinne caused morta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity actually, and in the event. The Apostle also affirming, that <hi>death entred by sinne, and passed upon all, in as much as all have sinned,</hi> seems to be of our mind. Neither can any other sufficient cause be assigned on the account whereof, innocent man should have been actually, mortall, or eventually have dyed. M. <hi>Biddle</hi> it seemes is of another perswasion. And for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his judgment, gives you the words of the Curse of God to man upon his sinning; <hi>dust thou art, and unto dust then shalt returne;</hi> The strength of his reason therein lying in this, that if God denounced the sentence of <hi>mortallity</hi> on man after his sinning, and for his sin, then mortallity was not an effect of sinne, but man was mortall before in the state of innocency, who doubts but that at this rate he may be able to prove what he pleases.</p>

                  <p>Thus, and much more fully, doth the Scripture set out, and declare the condition of man, both <hi>before</hi> and <hi>after</hi> the fall: concerning which, although the most evident demonstration of the latter, lyes in the Revelation made of the exceeding <hi>Efficacy</hi> of that power &amp; Grace, which God in Christ puts forth for our conversion, and delivery from that state and condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore described, yet so much is spoken of this <hi>darke</hi> side of it, as will render <hi>vaine</hi> the attempts of any, who shall endeavour to plead the cause of corrupted nature, or alleviate the Guilt of the <hi>first sinne.</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. That man was Created in the <hi>Image</hi> of God, in Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Righteousnesse, and Holinesse, is evident on the ensuing <note place="margin">§. 43.</note> considerations.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. He who was made <hi>very good and upright,</hi> in a morall confide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, had the <hi>Originall Righteousnesse</hi> pleaded for: for morall goodnesse, integrity, and uprightnesse, is equivalent unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse; so are the words used in the description of <hi>Job. cap. 1. v.</hi> 1. And <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>Ʋpright</hi> are termes equivalent. <hi>Psal.</hi> 33. 1. Now that man was made thus good and upright, was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested in the Scriptures, cited in answer to the question before proposed, concerning the condition wherein our first Parents were created. And indeed this Uprightnesse of man, this morall rectitude, was his formall aptitude, and fitnesse, for, and unto that obedience, which God required of him, and which was necessary for the end, whereunto he was created.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He who was created <hi>Perfect</hi> in his kind, was created <note place="margin">§. 44.</note> with the <hi>Originall Righteousnesse</hi> pleaded for. This is evident from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:115372:108"/> hence, because Righteousnesse and Holinesse is a perfection of a Rationall being, made for the service of God. This in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells is called the <hi>Truth,</hi> or that originall Holinesse and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which the Divells <hi>abode not in, Joh.</hi> 8. 44. Now (as before,) man was created <hi>very good and upright,</hi> therefore-perfect, as to his state and condition: and whatever is in him of imperfection, flows from the corruption and depravation of nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He that was created in the Image of God, was created <note place="margin">§. 45.</note> in a state of <hi>Righteousnesse, Holinesse,</hi> and <hi>Knowledge.</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> was created in the <hi>Image of God,</hi> is plainely affirmed in Scripture, and is not denyed. That by the Image of God is especially intended the qualitys mentioned, is manifest from that farther description of the Image of God, which we have given us in the Scriptures before produced, in answer to our first Question. And what is recorded of the first man in his primitive condition, will not suffer us to esteeme him such a baby in knowledge, as the <hi>Socinians</hi> would make him. His imposing of names on all Creatures, his knowing of his wife on first view, &amp;c. exempt him from that imputation. Yea the very <note n="n" place="margin">

                     </note> Heathens could conclude, that he was very wise indeed, who first gave names to things.</p>
                  <p n="2">II. For the disproving of that <hi>Mortallity,</hi> which they ascribe <note place="margin">§. 46.</note> to man in <hi>innocency.</hi> The ensuing Arguments may suffice.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He that was created in the Image of God in <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Holinesse,</hi> whilst he continued in that state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, was immortall. That man was so created, lyes under the demonstration of the foregoing Arguments, and Testimonyes. The Assertion thereupon, or the inference of <hi>Immortallity</hi> from the Image of God, appeares on this double consideration. 1. In our Renovation by Christ, unto the image of God, we are renewed to a blessed Immortallity: and our <hi>likenesse</hi> to God consisted no lesse in that, then in any other communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable property of his Nature. 2. Where ever is naturally perfect Righteousnesse, there is naturally perfect life, that is, Immortallity: this is included in the very tenour of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:115372:108"/> of the Law. <hi>If a man keep mystatutes he shall live in them, Levit.</hi> 18. 5.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That which the first man <hi>Contracted,</hi> &amp; drew upon himselfe <note place="margin">§. 47.</note> by sinne, was not <hi>naturall</hi> to him before he sinned: But that man contracted, and drew death upon himselfe, or made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe liable and obnoxious unto it by sinne, is proved by all the Texts of Scripture, that were produced above, in answer to our second Question. As <hi>Gen. 2. 17, 19. Rom. 5. 12, 14. chap.</hi> 6. 23. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which is besides, and <hi>contrary</hi> to nature, was not <note place="margin">§. 48.</note>
                     <hi>naturall</hi> to the first man: but death is besides, and contrary to nature, as the voyce of nature abundantly testifieth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to man in his primitive condition it was not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</p>
                  <p>Unto these may sundry other Arguments be added, from the <hi>Promise of the Law,</hi> the <hi>End</hi> of mans Obedience, His consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and state, denying all <hi>proximate</hi> causes of death, &amp;c. But these may suffice.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. That the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is not to be consined to the <note place="margin">§. 49.</note> meere eating of the fruit of <hi>the tree of knowledge of Good and Evill,</hi> but had its rise in <hi>Infidelity,</hi> and comprised universall Apostacy from God, in disobedience to the law of his creation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on God, I have elsewhere demonstrated, and shall <note place="margin">Diatrib. de Justit. Divin. Vin.</note> not need here againe to insist upon it. That it began in <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity,</hi> is evident from the beginning of the Temptation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was overcome. It was to doubt of the Truth, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity of God, to which the woman was at first sollicited by Sathan. <hi>Gen: 3. 4. Hath God said so?</hi> pressing that it should be otherwise, then they seemed to have cause to apprehend from what God said: And their acquiescence in that reply of Sathan, without revolving to the truth, and faithfullnesse of God, was plaine <hi>Ʋnbeliefe.</hi> Now as Faith is the root of all Righteousnesse and Obedience, so is <hi>Infidelity</hi> of all disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Being overtaken, conquered, <hi>deceived</hi> into infidelity, man gave up himselfe to act contrary to God, and his will, shooke off his soveraignty, rose up against his Law, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested the frame of his heart, in the pledge of his diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, eating the fruit that was sacramentally forbidden him.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:115372:109"/>IV. That all men sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> and that his sinne is imputed to all his Posterity, is by them denyed, but is easily <note place="margin">§. 50.</note> evinced. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By whom sinne <hi>entred into the world,</hi> so that all <hi>sinned in him,</hi> and are made <hi>sinners</hi> thereby, so that also his sinne is called the <hi>sinne of the world,</hi> in him all mankind sinned, and his sinne is imputed to them. But that this was the condition, and state of the first sinne of <hi>Adam,</hi> the Scriptures before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, in answer to our <hi>seventh question,</hi> do abundantly manifest; and thence also is his sinne called the sinne of the world: <hi>John</hi> 1. 29,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In whom <hi>all are dead,</hi> and in whom they have contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the guilt of death and condemnation, in him they have all <note place="margin">§. 51.</note> sinned, and have his sinne imputed to them. But in <hi>Adam all are dead: 1 Cor:</hi> 15. 22. as also <hi>Rom:</hi> 5. 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18. And death is the <hi>wages</hi> of sinne only, <hi>Rom:</hi> 6. 23.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As by the <hi>Obedience</hi> of Christ we are made <hi>Righteous,</hi> so by the <hi>disobedience</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> we are made <hi>sinners.</hi> So the Apostle <note place="margin">§. 52.</note> expressly, <hi>Rom:</hi> 5. but we are made <hi>Righteous</hi> by the Obedience of Christ, by the imputation of it to us, as if we had perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it: 1 <hi>Cor: 1. 30. Phil:</hi> 3. 9. Therefore are we <hi>sinners,</hi> by the imputation of the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> to us, as though we had committed it: which the Apostle also affirmes. To what hath been spoken, from the consideration of that state and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein by Gods appointment, in reference to all mankind, <hi>Adam</hi> was placed, namely, of a <hi>naturall,</hi> and <hi>politicall,</hi> or <hi>Faederall</hi> Head, (of which the Apostle treats, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) from the losse of that Image, wherein he was created, whereunto by Christ we are renewed, many more words like these might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>To what hath been spoken, there is no need that much should be added, for the removall of any thing insisted on, to <note place="margin">§. 53.</note> the same purpose with M. B's intimations, in the <hi>Raccovian Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme.</hi> But yet seeing that that task also is undertaken, that which may seeme necessary for the discharging of what may thence be expected, shall briefely be submitted to the Reader. To this Head they speake, in the first Chapter, of the way Salvation; the first Question whereof, is of the import en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing.</p>

                     <hi>Seeing thou saidst in the beginning, that this life, which leadeth to immortality, is Divinely revealed, I would know of thee, why thou saidst so?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A. <hi>Because, as man by nature hath nothing to do with immortality (or hath no interest in it) so by himselfe he could by no means know the way which leadeth to immortality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Propterea, quia ut homo naturâ nihil habet commune cum immortalitate, ita eam ipse viam, quae nos ad immortalitatem duceret, nulla ratione per se cognoseere potuit.</hi> Catech. Raccov. de via Salut cap. 1.</p>
                  <p>Both Question and Answer being sophistical and ambiguous, the sence and intendment of them, as to their application to the matter in hand, and by them aymed at, is first to be recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed by some few distinctions, and then the whole will cost us very little farther trouble.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is, or hath been, a twofold way to a blessed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortallity, (1.) The way of perfect Obedience to the Law, for he that did it was to <hi>live therein,</hi> (2.) the way of <hi>Faith</hi> in the bloud of the Sonne of God: For he that <hi>believeth</hi> shall be <hi>Saved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Man by nature may be considered two wayes, (1.) As he was in his created <hi>condition,</hi> not tainted, corrupted, weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor lost by sinne, (2.) As <hi>fallen,</hi> dead, polluted, and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Immortallity is taken either (1.) Nakedly, and purely in its selfe, for an eternall abiding of that which is said to be immortall. (2.) For a blessed condition, and state, in that abiding and continuance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That expression (<hi>by nature</hi>) referring to man in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted condition, not fallen by sinne, may be taken two wayes (1.) <hi>Strictly,</hi> for the consequences of the naturall principles whereof man was constituted, or (2.) More <hi>largely</hi> it compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes Gods constitution and appointment, concerning man in that estate.</p>
                  <p>On these considerations, it will be easy to take off this Head of our Catechist's discourse, whereby also the remaining trunke will fall to the ground.</p>
                  <p>I say then, man by <hi>nature,</hi> in his primitive created condition,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:115372:110"/> was by the appointment and constitution of God, <hi>immortall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2. 7, 8, 9</note> as to the continuance of his life, and knew the way of perfect <hi>legall Obedience,</hi> tending to a blessed <hi>Immortallity,</hi> and that by <hi>himselfe,</hi> or by vertue of the Law of his Creation, which was concreated with him: But <hi>fallen</hi> man in his naturall condition, being dead spiritually, obnoxious to death temporall and eternall, doth by no meanes know <hi>of himselfe,</hi> nor <hi>can know,</hi> the way of <hi>Faith</hi> in Jesus Christ, leading to a blessed immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity and Glory.</p>
                  <p>It is not then our want of interest in <hi>immortallity,</hi> upon the account whereof we know not of <hi>our selves</hi> the way to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity <note place="margin">§. 54.</note> by the bloud of Christ; but there are two other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that enforce the Truth of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because it is a way of <hi>meere Grace and mercy,</hi> hidden from all eternity in the treasures of Gods infinite Wisdome, and <note place="margin">Joh. 1. 18. 1 Cor. 2. 7. Ephes. 3. 8, 9, 10, 11.

                     <hi>Image of God, it is to be known, that the Image of God doth not signify immortallity; (which is evident from hence, because at that time, when man was subject to eternall death, the Scripture acknowledgeth in him that Image,</hi> Gen. 9. 6. Jam. 3. 9.) <hi>but it denoteth the power dominion over all things, made of God on the Earth: as the same place, where this Image is treated of, clearely sheweth:</hi> Gen. 1, 26.</p>
                  <p>The Argument for that state and Condition, wherein we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme man to have been created, from the consideration of the <hi>Image</hi> of God, wherein he was <hi>made,</hi> and whereunto in part we are <hi>renewed,</hi> was formerly insisted on. Let the Reader looke back unto it, and he will quickly discerne, how little is here offered to enervate it in the least. For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They cannot prove, that man in the condition and state of sinne, doth retaine any thing of the Image of God; the places mentioned, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 9, 6. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. 9. testify only, that he was made in the Image of God at first, but that he doth still retaine the image they intimate not; nor is the inference used in the places, taken from what man is, but what he was created.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Image</hi> of God did not consist in any one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, hath been above declared: So that the Argument to prove that it did not consist in immortallity, because it did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the dominion over the Creatures, is no better then that would be, which should conclude, that the Sun did not give light because it gives heat. So that</p>

Though the <hi>Image</hi> of God, as to the maine of it, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the end of everlasting communion with God, (whereunto we were created) was utterly lost by sinne, or else we could not be renewed unto it againe by Jesus Christ, yet as to some footsteps of it, in reference to our fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so much might be, and was retained, as to be a Reason

                  <p n="4">4. That place of <hi>Gen. 1. 26.

It is rather a grant made to them, who were made in the Image of God, then a description of <hi>that Image</hi> wherein they were made.</p>
                  <p>It is evident then, notwithstanding any thing here excepted to the contrary, that the Immortallity pleaded for, belonged to the Image of God, and from mans being created therein, is rightly inferred, as above was made more evident.</p>

The opposition that is put between the creation of man in integrity, and the Image of God, in one verse, and the entrance of sinne, by the envy of the Divell, in the next, plainely evinces, that the mind of the Authour of that book was, that man, by reason of his being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the image of God, was immortall in his primitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.

                     <hi>A. The Apostle in that place treateth not of immortallity, but of death it selfe. But mortallity differeth much from death: for a man may be mortall and yet never dye.</hi> But</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Apostle eminently treats of mans becomming obnox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to death, which untill he was, he was immortall. For he
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115372:112"/> sayes, that death entred the world by sinne, and passed on all men, not actually, but in the guilt of it, and obnoxiousnesse to it. By what means death entred into the world, or had a right so to do, by that meanes man lost the immortallity, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is true, a man may be mortall as to state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and yet by Almighty power be preserved, and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from actuall dying, as it was with <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah,</hi> but in an ordinary course he that is <hi>mortall</hi> must dye, &amp; is directly obnoxious to death: but that which we plead for from those words of the Apostle is, that man by Gods constitution and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, was so <hi>immortall,</hi> as not to be lyable, nor obnoxious to death, untill he sinned.

                     <hi>This, that Adam for sin by the decree and sentence of God, was subject to eternall death; and therefore all men, because, or in as much as they are borne of him, are subject to the same eternall death.

                  </p>
                  <p>Be it so: that this is the meaning of those words, yet hence it inevitably follows, that man was no way liable, or obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to death, but upon the account of the commination of God annexed to the law he gave him. And this is the whole of what we affirme: namely, that by Gods appointment man was <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall,</hi> and the tenure of his <hi>immortallity</hi> was his obedience; And thereupon, his Right thereunto he lost by his Trangressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This is farther evident from the comparison between Christ and <hi>Adam,</hi> instituted by the Apostle. For as we are all dead without Christ, and his <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> and have not the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>A. <hi>There is no such thing as Originall sinne: wherefore that cannot vitiate free will: Nor can that Original sin be proved out of the Scripture: and the fall of Adam being but one act, could not have that force as to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt his own nature, much lesse that of his Posterity. And that it was inflicted on him as a punishment, neither doth the Scripture teach, and it is incredible, that God, who is the fountaine of all goodnesse, would so do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. This is yet plaine dealing.

Can nothing of all this be proved from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? These <hi>Gentlemen</hi> know, that we contend not about words or expressions; let them grant this heriditary corruption of our natures, alienation from God, impotency to good, deadnesse and obstinacy in sinne, want of the Spirit, Image, and Grace of God, with obnoxiousnesse thereon to eternall condemnation; and give us a fitter expression to declare this state and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by, in respect of every ones personall interest therein, and we will, so it may please them, call <hi>it originall sinne</hi> no more.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A. <hi>These Testimonyes deale concerning voluntary sinne: from them therefore Originall sinne cannot be proved. As for the first, Moses sheweth it to be such a sinne for whose sake God repented him that he had made man and decreed to destroy him with a flood: which certainly can by no meanes be affirmed concerning a sinne which should be in no man by nature, such as they think Originall sinne to be. In the other he sheweth, that the sinne of man shall not have that efficacy, that God should punnish the would for it with a flood; which by no means agreeth to Originall sinne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this attempt of our Catechists is most vaine and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous, <note place="margin">§. 67.</note> will quickly appeare, for 1. Suppose Originall sinne
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:115372:114"/> be not asserted in those places, doth it follow there is no Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sin? do they not know, that we affirme it to be revealed in, and proved by an hundred places besides? And doe they think to overthrow it by their exception against two or three of them? when if it be taught in any one of them it suffices. 2. The words as by them rendred, loose much of the efficacy for the confirmation of what they oppose, which in the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall they have. In the first place, it is not <hi>every thought of mans heart,</hi> but every imagination or figment of <hi>the thoughts of his heart.</hi> The <hi>motus primo primi,</hi> the very naturall frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the heart of man, as to its first motions towards good or evill, are doubtlesse expressed in these words: so also is it in the latter place.</p>
                  <p>We say then, that <hi>Originall sin</hi> is taught &amp; proved in these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Not singly or exclusively to actuall sinnes, not <hi>a parte</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 68.</note>
                     <hi>ante,</hi> or from the causes of it, but from its effects. That such a frame of heart is universally by nature in all mankind, and every <hi>individuall</hi> of them, as that it is ever, always, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally casting, coyning, and devising evill, and that <hi>only,</hi> without the intermixture of any thing of another kind, that is truly and spiriritually good, is taught in these places; and this is Originall sinne. Nor is this disproved by our <hi>Catechists.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because the sinne spoken of is voluntary, therefore it i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not Originall, will not be granted. Originall sin, as it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <note place="margin">§. 69.</note> for <hi>peccatum Originans,</hi> was voluntary in <hi>Adam;</hi> and as it is <hi>Originatum</hi> in us, is in our wills habitually, and not against them, in any actings of it, or them. (2.) The Effects of it in the coyning of sinne, and in the <hi>thoughts</hi> of mens hearts, are all voluntary; which are here mentioned to demonstrate, and manifest that roote from whence they spring, that prevailing <hi>principle,</hi> and predominant habit, from whence they so uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formely proceed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Why it doth not agree to <hi>Originall sin,</hi> that the account men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>v.</hi> 6. of Gods repenting that He made man, and his reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to destroy him, these Gentlemen offer not one word of Reason to manifest. We say, that it can agree to no other, but this originall sinne, with its infallible effects, wherein all mankind are equally concerned, and so became
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:115372:114"/> equally lyable to the just Judgment of God; though some from the same Principle had acted much more boldly against his Holy Majesty then others: (2.) Its being in men by nature doth not at all l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ssen its guilt. It is not in <hi>their nature</hi> as created, nor in them so by nature: but is by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> come upon the nature of all men, dwelling in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of every one; which lesseneth not its guilt, but manifests its advantage for provocation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Why the latter testimony is not applicable to Originall sinne, they informe us not. The words joyned with it, are an expression of that patience, and forbearance which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, and promised to exercise towards the world, with a <hi>non Obstante,</hi> for <hi>sin.</hi> Now what sin should this be, but that which is the sin of the world. That actuall sinnes are excluded we say not; but that <hi>Originall sinne</hi> is expressed, and aggravated by the Effects of it, our <hi>Catechists</hi> cannot disprove. There are many considerations of these Texts, from whence the Argument from them, for the proof of that corruption of nature, which we call <hi>Originall sin,</hi> might be much <hi>improved;</hi> but that is not my present businesse; Our Catechists administring no occasion to such a Discourse. But they take some other texts into considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is to be observed, that David doth not here speake of any men but himselfe alome nor that simply, but with respect to his fall: and uses that forme of speaking, which you have in him againe, Psal. 58. 4. Wherefore Originall sinne cannot be evinced by this Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Though <hi>David</hi> speake of himselfe, yet he speakes of himselfe, in respect of that which was common to▪ himselfe with all mankind, being a <hi>child of wrath as well as others.</hi> Nor can these Gentlemen intimate any thing of sinne and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, in the <hi>conception and birth of David,</hi> that was not common
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115372:115"/> to all others with him. Any mans confession for himselfe of a particular guilt in a common sinne, doth not free others from it. Yea it proves all others to be partakers in it, who share in that condition wherein he contracted the guilt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though <hi>David</hi> mention this by occasion of his fall, as having his conscience made tender, and awakened to search into the roote of his sinne, and transgression thereby; yet it was no part of his fall, nor was he ever the more or lesse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

He here acknowledges it, upon the occasion of his fall, which was a fruit of the sinne wherewith he was borne, <hi>James</hi> 1. 14, 15. but was equally guilty of it before his fall and after.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The expression here used, and that of <hi>Psal. 58. 3. The wicked are enstranged from the wombe, they goe astray as soon as they be borne spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king lyes;</hi> exceedingly differ. Here <hi>David</hi> expresses what was his infection in the womb, there what is wicked mens constant practise from the womb. In himselfe he mentions the roote of all actuall sin; in them the constant fruit that springs from that root in imregenerate men. So that by the favour of these Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chists, I yet say, that <hi>David</hi> doth here acknowledge a sin of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a sin wherewith he was defiled from his conception, and polluted when he was warmed, and so somented in his Mothers womb, and therefore this place doth prove Originall sinne.</p>

I wonder how our Catechists could once imagine; that this exception against the Translation of those words, should enervate the Argument from the text, for the proofe of all mens guilt of the first sinne; seeing the conviction of it, is no lesse evident from the words, if rendred according to their desire.</p>

                  <head>EXAMINATION.</head>
                  <p>THE aime and designe of our Catechist in this Chapter, being to despoile our blessed Lord Jesus Christ of his <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>
                     <hi>Eternall Deity,</hi> and to substitute an imaginary God-head, made, and feigned in the vaine hearts of himselfe &amp; his Masters, into the roome thereof, I hope the discovery of the wickednesse and vanity of his attempt, will not be unacceptable to them, who <hi>love him in sincerity.</hi> I must still desire the Reader, not to expect the handling of the Doctrine of the Deity of Christ at large, with the confirmation of it, &amp; vindication from the vaine Sophismes, wherewith by others, as well as by M. B. it hath been opposed. This is done abundantly by other hands. In the next chapters that also will have its proper place, in the vindication of many Texts of <hi>Scripture</hi> from the exceptions of the <hi>Raccovians.</hi> The removall of M. B's Sophistry, &amp; the disintangling of weaker soules, who may in any thing be intricated by his Queries, is my present intendment. To make our way cleare and plaine, that every one that runnes may read the vanity of M. B's underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king against the Lord Jesus, and his <hi>kicking against the pricks</hi> therein, I desire to premise these few observations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Distinction of persons (it being in an <hi>Infinite</hi> substance) doth no way prove difference of Essence between the Father <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> and the Sonne. Where Christ as Mediatour is said to be another from the Father, or God, spoken <hi>personally</hi> of the Father, it argues not in the least, that he is not partaker of the same nature with him. That in one Essence there can be but one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, may be true where the Substance is <hi>Finite,</hi> and limited, but hath no place in that which is <hi>infinite.</hi>

The Scriptures asserting the Humanity of Christ with <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> the concernments thereof, as his <hi>birth, life,</hi> and <hi>death,</hi> doth no more thereby deny his Deity, then by asserting his Deity, with the Essentiall Propertyes thereof, Eternity, Omniscience, and the like, it denyes his Humanity.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. God's working any thing in and by Christ as he was <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Mediatour, denotes the Fathers soveraigne <hi>Appointment</hi> of the things mentioned to be done, not his immediate <hi>Efficiency</hi> in the doing of the things themselves.</p>
                  <p>The consideration of these few things being added to what I have said before in generall, about the way of dealing with our Adversaries in these great and weighty things of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, will easily deliver us from any great trouble, in the Examination of M. B's Arguments, and insinuations against the Deity of Christ, which is the businesse of the present Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>His first Question is, <note place="margin">§. 7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>How many Lords of Christians are there by way of distinction from that one God.</hi> And he Answers Ephes. 4. 5. <hi>One Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That of these two words there is not one that lookes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the confirmation of what M. <hi>Biddle</hi> chiefely aymes at, in the Question proposed, is I presume sufficiently cleare in the light of the thing it selfe enquired after. Christ it is true, is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115372:117"/> the <hi>one Lord</hi> of Christians; and therefore God equall with the Father. He is also <hi>one Lord,</hi> in distinction from his Father, <hi>as</hi> his Father, in respect of his personallity; in which regard, there are <hi>three that beare witnesse in Heaven,</hi> of which he is one; but in respect of Essence and Nature <hi>He and his Father are one.</hi> Farther, unlesse he were one <hi>God</hi> with his Father, it is utterly impossible he should be the <hi>one Lord</hi> of Christians. That he cannot be <hi>our Lord</hi> in the sence intended, whom we ought to invocate and worship, unlesse also he were <hi>our God,</hi> shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards declared. And although he be our Lord in distinction from his Father, as he is also our Mediatour, yet he is the same God with him <hi>which worketh all in all, 1 Cor.</hi> 12 6. His being Lord then distinctly, in respect of his mediation, hinders not his being God, in respect of his participation in the same nature with his Father. And though here he be not spoken of in respect of his absolute soveraigne <hi>Lordship,</hi> but of his <hi>Lordship</hi> over the Church to whō the whole Church is spiritually subject, (as he is elsewere also so called on the same account, as <hi>Joh. 13. 13. Act. 7. 59. Rev.</hi> 22. 20.) yet were he not Lord in that sence also, he could not be so in this. The <hi>Lord</hi> our <hi>God</hi> only is to be worshipped: <hi>My Lord and my God,</hi> says <hi>Thomas.</hi> And the mention of one God, is here, as in other places, partly to deprive all false Gods of their pretended Deity, partly to witnesse against the impossibillity of <hi>Polytheisme,</hi> and partly to manifest the onenesse of them who are worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as God, the Father, Word, and Spirit, all which things are also severally testifyed unto.</p>
                  <p>His second Question is an enquiry after this Lord who he is, <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> in these words, <hi>Who is this Lord?</hi> And the Answer is from 1 <hi>Cer. 8. 6. Jesus Christ by whom are all things.</hi> The close of this second answer might have caused M. B. a little to recoyle upon his insinuation in the first, concerning the distinction of this <hi>one Lord</hi> from that <hi>one God,</hi> in the sence by him insisted o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And it is manifest that he himselfe was not made, by whō all things were made. For he made not himselfe; not could so do, unles be were both before &amp; after himself; nor was he made without his own concurrence by another, fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> by himselfe are all things. Thus M. B. hath no sooner opened his mouth to speak against the Lord Jesus Christ, but by the just
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:115372:118"/> Judgement of God, he stops it himselfe with a testimony of God against himselfe, which he shall never be able to rise up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst unto Eternity.</p>
                  <p>And it is a manifest perverting &amp; corrupting of the Text which we have in <hi>Grotius</hi> his Glosse upon the place, who interprets the <note place="margin">Groti. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. in 1. <hi>Cor. 8. 6.</hi>

                  <p>His enquiry in the next place is after the <hi>birth of Jesus Christ,</hi> In answer whereunto the Story is reported from <hi>Mathew</hi> and <note place="margin">§. 9.</note>

                  <p>Qu. 4, 5. <hi>How came Jesus Christ to be Lord according to the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Apostle Paul?</hi> The Answer is Rom. 14. 19. <note place="margin">§. 10.</note>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:115372:118"/> Testimony of the Holy Ghost unto. He was no lesse made a <hi>Lord,</hi> then a <hi>Priest,</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> of his Father; but that the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Lordship of Christ, as he is one with his Father, <hi>God blessed for ever more,</hi> is any way denyed by the asserting of this Lordship given him of his Father as Mediatour, M. B. wholly beggs of <note place="margin">Rom. 9. 5.</note> men to apprehend &amp; grant, but doth not once attempt from the Scripture to manifest or prove. The summe of what M. <hi>Biddle</hi> intends to Argue hence is, Christs submitting himselfe to the <hi>forme</hi> &amp; worke of a <hi>servant</hi> unto the Father, was exalted by him, and had a <hi>name given him above every name,</hi> Therefore he was not the Sonne of God, and equall to him.

                  <p>The intendment of M. <hi>Biddle</hi> in this Question, as is evident by his inserting of these words in a different Character. [<hi>by a divine nature of his own, and because he was God himselfe,</hi>] is to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, or insinuate an answer unto the Argument, taken from the Miracles that Christ did, to confirme his Deity. The naked working of Miracles, I confesse, without the influence of such other Considerations, as this Argument is attended withall, in relation to Jesus Christ, will not alone of itselfe assert a divine nature in him, who is the instrument of their working or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. Though they are from divine power, or they are not <hi>miracles,</hi> yet it is not necessary, that he by whō they are wrought, should be possessour of that divine Power, as <hi>by whom</hi> may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note the instrumentall, and not the principall cause of them. But for the Miracles wrought by Jesus Christ, as God is said to do them <hi>by him,</hi> because he appointed him to doe them, as he designed him to his offices, and thereby gave Testimony to the Truth of the Doctrine he preached from his bosome, as also because he was with him, not in respect of power and virtue, but as the Father in the Sonne, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 38. So he working these miracles by his own power; and at his own will, even as his Father doth, <hi>Iob</hi> 5. 21. and himselfe giving power and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to others to worke miracles by his strength, and in his name, <hi>Mat. 10. 8. Mark. 16. 17, 18 Luk.</hi> 10. 19. There is that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent evidence of his Deity in his working of miracles, as M. B. can by no meanes darken or obscure, by pointing to that which is of a cleare consistency therewithall: as is his Fathers appointment of him to do them whereby he is said to do them in his name, &amp;c. as in the place cited; of which afterwards.

If I doe not the workes of my Father believe me not. But if I doe, though ye believe not me, believe the workes, that you may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi> In the doing of these workes, the Father was so with him, as that he was in Him, and He in the Father.

                  <p>His 7. Question is exceeding implicate and involved: a great deale is expressed that M.

                  <p>The Inference which alone appeares from hence, is of the same nature with them that are gone before. That Christ could not do all things of himselfe, that He was not the Eternall Sonne of God, that He tooke not flesh, is that which is asserted; but the proofe of all this doth disprove. Christ being accused by the Jewes, and persecuted for healing a man on the <hi>Sabbath day,</hi> and their rage being increased, by his asserting his Equality with the Father (of which afterwards) <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. He lets them know, that in the discharge of the office committed to Him,

Wherein he is so farre from declining the Assertion of his own Deity (which that he maintained, the Jewes apprehended, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, that he made himselfe equall with God, whith none but God is, or can be, for between God, and that which is not God, there is no proportion, much lesse Equallity) as that he farther confirmes it, by affirming, that he <hi>doth whatever the Father doth, and that as the Father quickneth whom he will, so He quickneth whom he will.</hi> That redoubled assertion then of Christ, that he can do nothing of himselfe, is to be applied to the matter under consideration.

                  <p>His 8<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Question is of the very same import with that going before, attempting to exclude Jesus Christ from the <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> Unity of Essence with his Father, by his Obedience to him, and his Fathers Acceptation of him in the worke of Mediation; which being a most ridiculous beggin of the thing in Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as to what he pretends in the Query to be Argumentative, that I shall not farther insist upon it.</p>
                  <p>Q. 9. We are come to the head of this Discourse, and of <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> M. B's designe in this Chapter; and indeed of the greatest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe that he drives in Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The denyall of the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Deity of the Sonne of God, which not only in this place directly, but in sundry others covertly he doth invade and oppose. His Question is, <hi>Doth the Scripture account Christ to be the Sonne of God, because he was Eternally begotten out of the divine Essence, or for other reasons agreeing to him only as a man? Rehearse the passages to this purpose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His Answer is from Luk. 1 31, 32, 34, 35. John 10. 36. Acts <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> 13. 32, 33. Rev. 1. 5. Col. 1. 18. Heb. 1-4, 5. Heb. 5. 5.

                  <p>This I say being the head of the difference between us in this Chapter, after I have rectifyed one mistake in M.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Doth the Scripture account Christ to be the Sonne of God, because he was Eternally beggotten out of the Divine Essence, or for other Reasons agreeing to him only as a man? Rebearse the passages to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reasons as farre as I can gather which M. B. layes at the bottome of this appellation, are 1. His <hi>birth</hi> of the Virgin from <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. 2. His <hi>Mission,</hi> or sending into
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115372:121"/> the world by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 36. 3. His <hi>Resurrection</hi> with power, <hi>Act. 13. 32, 33. Rev. 1. 5. Col.</hi> 1. 18. 4. His <hi>Exaltation, Heb. 5. 5. Rom.</hi> 8. 29.</p>
                  <p>For the removeal of all this, from prejudicing the eternall Son<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Jesus Christ, there is an abundant sufficiency arising from the consideration of this one Argument. If Jesus Christ be called the Son of God, antecedently to his <hi>Incarnation, Mission, Resurrection,</hi> and <hi>Exaltation,</hi> then there is a reason and cause of that Appellation, before, and above all these Considerations; and it cannot be on any of these accounts that he is called the <hi>Sonne of God:</hi> but that he is so called antecedently to all these, I shall afterward abundantly manifest. Yet a little farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in this businesse, as to the particulars intimated, may not be unseasonable.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then I shall propose the causes, on the account whereof <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> alone these men affirme that Jesus Christ is called the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God. Of these the first and chiefest they insist upon is, His <hi>Birth of the Virgin: viz.</hi> that he was called the Sonne of God, because he was conceived of the Holy Ghost, this our <hi>Catechist</hi> in the first place proposes; And before him his Masters. So the <hi>Recovlans</hi> in answer to that question.</p>

                  <p>But now least any one should say, that they can see no reason <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> why Christ should be called the Sonne of God, because he was so conceived by the Holy Ghost, nor wherefore God should therefore in a peculiar manner, and more eminently, then in respect of any other, be called the Father of Christ, to prevent any objection that on this hand might arise, <hi>Smalcius</hi> gives an account whence this is, &amp; why God is called the <hi>Father of Christ,</hi> and what he did in his Conception; which, for the Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, I had rather you should heare in his words then in mine. In his answer to the second part of the refutation of <hi>Socinus</hi> by <hi>Smiglecius, cap.</hi> 17, 18. he contends to manifest, and make good, that Christ was the <hi>Sonne of God according to the flesh,</hi> in direct opposition to that of the Apostle, <hi>He was of the seed of David according to the flesh, declared to be the Sonne of God, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 1. 3, 4. He sayes then <hi>cap. 18. p. 156. Socinus affirmat Deum in genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Christi vices patris supplevisse.</hi>—but how I pray? why! <hi>Satis est ad ostendendum, Deum in generatione Christi vices viri supple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visse, si ostendatur, Deum id ad Christi generationem adjecisse, quod in generatione hominis ex parte viri, ad hominem producendum adjeci solet:</hi> but what is that, or how is that done? <hi>Nos Dei virtutem in Virginis uterum aliquam substantiam creatam vel immisisse, aut ibi creasse affirmamus, ex qua juncto eo, quod ex ipsius Virginis substantia accessit, verus homo generatus fuit. Alias enim homo ille, Dei Filius a conceptione &amp; nativitate proprie non fuisset. cap. 17. pag.</hi> 150. Very good, unlesse this abominable sigment may passe current, Christ was not the Sonne of God. Let the Reader observe by the way, that they cannot but acknowledge Christ to have been, and to have been called the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> in a most peculiar manner: To avoid the evidence of the inference from thence, that therefore he is God, of the same substance with his Father, They only have this <hi>shift,</hi> to say he is called the <hi>Son of God,</hi> upon the account of that, whereof there is not the least tittle, nor word in the whole booke of God; yea which is expressly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Testimony thereof; &amp; unlesse this be granted they affirme that Christ cannot be called the Son of God. But let us heare this great <hi>Rabbi</hi> of M. B's <hi>religion</hi> a little farther <hi>clearing</hi> up this <hi>mistery.

And thus farre are men arrived. Unlesse this horrible <hi>sigment</hi> may be admitted, Christ is not the Sonne of God. He who is the <hi>true God and eternall Life,</hi> will one day plead the cause of his own glory against these men.</p>
                  <p>I insist somewat the more on these things, that men may judge <note place="margin">§. 22.</note> the <hi>better,</hi> whether in all probability M. <hi>Biddle</hi> in his <hi>impartiall</hi> search into the Scripture, did not use the helpe of some of them that went before him, in the discovery of the same things, which He <hi>boasts</hi> Himselfe to have found out.</p>
                  <p>And this is the first reason which our <hi>Catechist</hi> hath taken <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> from his <hi>Masters,</hi> to communicate to his <hi>Schollers,</hi> why Jesus Christ is called the Sonne of God.

                  <p>The other causes which they assigne, why he is called the <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> Sonne of God, I shall very briefely point unto. By the way that hath been spoken of, they say he was the Sonne of God; the naturall Sonne of God. But they say he was the Sonne of God, before he was God. He grew afterward to be a <hi>God</hi> by degrees as he had those Graces, and excellencyes, and that power given him, wherein his God-head doth consist. So that He was the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, but not God (in their own sence) untill a while after. And then when he was so made a God, He came thereby to be more the Sonne of God. But by this addition to his Sonship he became the adopted Sonne of God: as by being begotten, as was before revealed, he was the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Son of God. Let us heare <hi>Smalcius</hi> a little opening these
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:115372:123"/> misteries; <q>Neither (saith he) was Christ God, all the while <note place="margin">

To be the Sonne of God, is refer'd, to his birth, and all understand how one may be call'd the Sonne of God, for his birth or originall But God none can be (besides that one God) but for his likenesse to God, So that when Christ was made like God, by the divine. Qualities which were in him, he was most rightly so farre the Sonne of God, as he was God, and so farre God, as he was the Sonne of God. But before he had obtained that likenesse to God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly he could not be said to be God.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And these are some of those monstrous sigments which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> pretence of <hi>bare adherence</hi> to the Scripture, our <hi>Catechist</hi> would obtrude upon us. First Christ is the Sonne of God. Then growing like God in divine Qualities, he is made a God, and so becomes more the Sonne of God. And this, if the man may be believed, is the pure Doctrine of the Scripture. And if Christ be a God, because he is like God, by the same reason we are all Gods in M. B's conceit, being all made in the Image and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, which (sayes he) by sinne we have not lost.</p>
                  <p>But what kind of Sonship is added to Christ by all these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencyes, <note place="margin">§. 26.</note> whereby he is made like to God? The same author tells us, that it is a <hi>Sonship by adoption,</hi> and that Christ on these accounts was the <hi>adopted Sonne of God.</hi>

Seeing that such is the property and condition of an adopted Sonne
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:115372:124"/> that he is not borne such as he is afterward made by adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; certainely seeing that Christ was not such by nature, or in his conception and nativity as he was afterward in hs suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding age, he may justly on that account be called the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted Son of God.</q> Such miserable plunges doth Sathan drive men into, whose <hi>eyes he hath once blinded,</hi> that the glorious light of the Gospell should not shine into them.

                  <p>The reasons they commonly adde, why in this sence Christ <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> is called the Sonne of God, are the same which they give, why He is called God. <q>He is the only begotten Sonne of God, <note place="margin">

He answers himselfe: there is, namely, his <hi>Eternall Generation</hi> of the Father; His being <hi>God</hi> of <hi>God</hi> from all Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">Insti. Theol. lib. 4. Sect. 2. c. 33. p. 335.</note> which he pursues with sundry Arguments; And yet in the close disputes, that the acknowledgement of this Truth is not <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> or the denyall of it exclusive of Salvation. So this great reconciler of the <hi>Arminian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Religions, whole composition and unity, into an opposition to them whom he calls <hi>Galvinists,</hi> is the great designe of his <hi>Theologicall, institutions,</hi> and such at this day is the ayme of <hi>Curcullaeus,</hi> &amp; some others. By the way I shall desire, (before I answer what he offers to confirme his Assignation of this <hi>foure fold</hi> manner of <hi>Filiation</hi> to Jesus Christ) to aske this learned <hi>Gentleman</hi> (or
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:115372:125"/> these of his mind who do survive him) this one Question seeing that Jesus Christ was from eternity the Son of God, and is called so after his Incarnation, and was on that account in his whole person the Sonne of God, by their own confessions, what tittle he or they can find in the Scripture of a <hi>manifold Filiation</hi> of Jesus Christ, in respect of God his Father, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be not a diminution of his glory, to be called the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> upon any lower account, as by a new addition to him, who was <hi>eternally</hi> his only begotten Sonne, by vertue of his <hi>Eternall Generation</hi> of his own substance?</p>
                  <p>Having thus discovered the minde of them with whom we <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> have to doe, and from whom our <hi>Catechist</hi> hath borrowed his <hi>discoveries,</hi> I shall briefely do these two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Shew that the <hi>Filiation</hi> of Christ consists in his generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the substance of his Father from Eternity; or that he is the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> upon the account of his <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence therein, antecedent to his Incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it consists <hi>solely</hi> therein, and that he was not, nor was called the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> upon any other account, but that mentioned; and therein answer what by M. B. or others is objected to the contrary.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To which I shall adde Testimonies &amp; Arguments for the Deity of Christ, whose opposition is the maine businesse of that <hi>new</hi> Religion, which M. <hi>Biddle</hi> would Catechise poore unstable soules into, in the vindication of those excepted against by the <hi>Racovians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the demonstration of the first Assertion, I shall insist on some few of the Testimonies and Arguments, that might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced <note place="margin">§. 30.</note> for the same purpose.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He who is the <hi>True, Proper, only begotten Sonne of God, of the</hi>

And the whole <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> manifests, that they did in it acknowledge both his <hi>Office</hi> of being the Mediatour, and his <hi>divine nature,</hi> or person also. Thou <hi>art the Christ,</hi> those words comprize all the causes of <hi>Filiation,</hi> insisted on by them with whom we have to doe, and the whole office of the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Christ, but yet hereunto they adde, the <hi>Sonne of the Living God:</hi> expressing his divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and <hi>Sonship</hi> on that account.</p>
                  <p>And we know that the <hi>Son of God is come, and hath given is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding,</hi> that we may know him that is true; and we are in him that is true, even in his <hi>Son Iesus Christ, this is the true God, &amp; eternall Life, Ioh.</hi> 5. 20.

Not that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of <hi>Adoption,</hi> but this of <hi>Nature,</hi> as shall afterwards appeare.</p>
                  <p>Againe, he who is <hi>properly</hi> a Sonne, is distinguished from him who is <hi>metaphorically</hi> so only.

So that it is a plaine contradiction, that Christ should be the <hi>proper</hi> Sonne of God, and yet not be <hi>begotten</hi> of his Fathers Essence. Besides, in that 8<seg rend="sup">th</seg> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the Apostle had before mentioned other <hi>Sonnes of God,</hi> who became so by <hi>Adoption, v.</hi> 15, 16. but when he comes to speake of Christ, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to them, he calls Him <hi>Gods own, or proper Sonne,</hi> that is, his <hi>naturall Sonne,</hi> they being so only by <hi>Adoption.</hi> And in the very words themselves, the distance that is given him by way of <hi>Eminence</hi> above all other things, doth sufficiently evince in what sence he is called the proper Sonne of God. <hi>He that spared not his own Son, how shall he not with him give us all things?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:115372:126"/> to this sonship of Christ in his Confession, <hi>thou art the Sonne of the Living God,</hi> and the ground of Christs <hi>Filiation</hi> will be yet more evident. Why the <hi>Sonne of the living God,</hi> unlesse as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of God, as the living God, as living things beget of their own substance? but of that place before. Christ then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>true, proper, beloved, only begotten Sonne of the living God,</hi> is his Naturall Sonne, of his own substance and Essence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The same Truth may have farther evidence given unto <note place="margin">§. 38.</note> it, from the consideration of what <hi>kind</hi> of <hi>Sonne</hi> of God Jesus Christ is. He who is <hi>such</hi> a Sonne as is <hi>equall</hi> to his Father in Essence and properties; He is a <hi>Sonne begotten of the Essence of his Father.</hi> Nothing can give such an <hi>Equality,</hi> but a <hi>Communication</hi> of Essence. Then, with God Equality of <hi>Essence</hi> can alone give Equality of Dignity, and Honour. For between that Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Power, and Honour, which belongs to God, as God, and that Dignity or Honour, that is, or may be given to any other, there is no proportion, much lesse Equality, as shall be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced at large afterwards. And this is the sole Reason, why a Sonne is <hi>equall</hi> to his Father in <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> because he hath from him a Communication of the <hi>same</hi> Essence, whereof He is partaker. Now that Christ is such a Sonne, as hath been mentioned, the Scripture abundantly testifies. <hi>My Father</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>worketh hitherto, and I worke: therefore the Jewes sought the more to kill him, not only because he had broken the Sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himselfe equall with God, Joh. 5. 17, 18. v.</hi> 17. having called God his Father, in the particular manner before mentioned, and affirmed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe an <hi>equall nature, and power</hi> for operation with his Father, the <hi>Iewes</hi> thence inferre, that he testifyed of himselfe, that he was such a <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> as that he was <hi>equall</hi> with God.</p>

For these termes are the same, and of the same importance. But this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of Christ as to his <hi>Sonship,</hi> which the Holy Ghost gives us. <hi>Begotten</hi> he was of the Father according to his own Testimony; <hi>Thou art my Sonne this day have I begotten thee, Psal.</hi> 2. 7.

That God was his Father, and he the son of God, because after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection he was made an <hi>heavenly</hi> King, is an <hi>hellish sigment.</hi> Neither is there any one word or tittle in the Texts cited to prove it: that it is a marvell to what end they are mentioned, one of them expressly affirming, that He was the Son of God before his Resurrection <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

<pb n="177" facs="tcp:115372:130"/> for the proofe and evincing of the <hi>Eternall Deity</hi> of the Sonne of God, the proposition is unmoveably established, and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence evidently followes thereupon.</p>
                  <p>But yet the proposition as layd down may admit of farther <note place="margin">§. 54.</note> confirmation at present. It is then testified to, <hi>Prov. 30. 4.

But of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the following Chapter I shall speake at large.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christ was so the Son of God, that he that was made <hi>like</hi>

                     <hi>Him</hi> was to be without <hi>Father, Mother, or Genealogy, Heb. 7. 3.

                  <p n="4">4. That which only manifests the <hi>filiation</hi> of Christ, is not the <note place="margin">§. 56.</note> cause of it. The cause of a thing is that which gives it, its being. The manifestation of it is only that which declares it to be so. That all the things insisted on, as the causes of <hi>Christs Filiation,</hi> by them with whom we have to do, did only declare &amp; manifest him so to be, who was the Son of God, the Scripture witnesseth. <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee, therefore also that holy thing, which shall be borne of thee shall be called the Sonne of God.

He shall be <hi>called</hi> so being thereby declared to be so. <hi>And great is the Mystery of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, God was manifested in the flesh, justifyed in the spirit, seene of Angells, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received

All the causes of Christs <hi>Filiation,</hi> assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by our Adversaries, are evidently placed as manifestations of God in him; or his being the Sonne of God: <hi>Declared to be the Sonne of God with power, according to the spirit of Holinesse, by the Resurrection from the dead, Rom.</hi> 1. 3. The Absurdity of assigning distinct, &amp; so farre different causes of the same Effect of fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, whether you make them totall, or partiall, need not be insisted on.</p>
                  <p>Farther (to adde one consideration more) sayes <hi>Socinus,</hi> Christ was the sonne of God, upon the account of his <hi>Holinesse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 57.</note> and <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> and therein his <hi>likenesse</hi> to God. Now this he had not according to his principles in his Infancy. He proves <hi>Adam</hi> not to have been righteous in the state of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, because he had yielded <hi>actuall obedience to no Law.</hi> No <note place="margin">Praelect. cap. 8, 9, 10.</note> more had Christ done in his Infancy. Therefore (1.) He was not the sonne of God upon the account of his <hi>Nativity.</hi> Nor (2.) did he become the sonne of God any otherwise then we do, <hi>viz.</hi> by hearing the Word, learning the Mind, and doing the Will of God. (3.) God did not give his only begotten sonne for us, but gave the sonne of <hi>Mary,</hi> that he might (by all that which we supposed he had done for us) be made the <hi>sonne of God.</hi> And so (4) This sending of Christ doth not so much commend the <hi>Love of God</hi> to us, as to him, that he sent him to dye &amp; rise, that he might be made God, &amp; the son of God. Neither (5.) can any eximious love to us of Christ, be seen in what he did &amp; suffered; for had he not done and suffered what he did, he had not been the sonne of God. And also (6.) if Christ be on the account of his <hi>Excellencyes, Groces,</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> the Sonne of God, which is one way of his Filiation insisted on, and to be God, and the Sonne of God, is as they say all one; and as it is indeed; then all who are renewed to the Image of God, and are thereby the <hi>Sonnes of God</hi> (as are all believers) are <hi>Gods</hi> also.</p>
                  <p>And this that hath been spoken, may suffice for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the second Assertion, laid down at the entrance of this discourse.</p>
                  <p>To the farther confirmation of this Assertion, two things are to be annexed. First, the Eversion of that <hi>fancy</hi> of <hi>Episcopius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 58.</note> before mentioned, and the rest of the <hi>Socinianizing Arminians,</hi>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:115372:131"/> that Christ is called the <hi>sonne of God,</hi> both on the account of his <hi>Eternall sonship,</hi> and also of those other particulars mentioned from him above. 2. To consider the texts of Scripture produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>M. B.</hi> for the confirmation of his insinuation, that Christ is not called the Son of God, because of his <hi>eternall Generation of the Essence of his Father.</hi> The first may easily be evinced by the ensuing Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The question formerly proposed to <hi>Episcopius</hi> may be <note place="margin">§. 59.</note> renued. For if Christ be the Sonne of God, partly upon the account of his Eternall Generation, and so he is Gods proper and naturall Sonne, and partly upon the other accounts men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Then</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is partly Gods <hi>naturall</hi> Son, and partly his <hi>adopted</hi> Son; partly his <hi>eternall</hi> Son, partly a <hi>temporary</hi> Son; partly a <hi>begotten</hi> Son, partly a <hi>ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>e</hi> Son. Of which distinction in reference to Christ, there is not one <hi>Iota</hi> in the whole Book of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is <hi>made</hi> the sonne of God, by that which only mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fests Him to be the sonne of God, as the things mentioned do.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Christ is <hi>equivocally</hi> only, and not <hi>univocally</hi> called the son of God: for that which hath various and diverse causes of its being <hi>so,</hi> is <hi>so equivocally.</hi> If the Filiation of Christ hath such <hi>equivocall</hi> causes, as Eternall generation, <hi>actuall Incarnation,</hi> and <hi>Exaltation,</hi> he hath an <hi>equivocall</hi> Filiation: which whether it be consistent with the scripture, which calls him the <hi>proper Sonne of God,</hi> needs no great paines to determine.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The scripture never conjoynes these causes of Christs Filiation, as causes in, and of the same kind; but expressly <note place="margin">§. 60.</note> makes the one the sole cause <hi>constituting,</hi> &amp; the rest, causes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing only; as hath been declared. And to shut up this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; if Christ be the <hi>Sonne of man only,</hi> because he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the substance of his Mother, He is the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> only, upon the account of his being begotten of the substance of his Father.</p>
                  <p>There remaineth only the consideration of those Texts of scripture, which M. <hi>Biddle</hi> produceth to insinuate the <hi>Filiation</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 61.</note> of Christ to depend on other causes, and not his Eternall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the Essence of his Father, which on the principles
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:115372:132"/> lay'd down and proved, will receive a quick and speedy dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch.</p>
                  <p>The first place named by him, and universally insisted on by the whole tribe, is <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35. It is the last <note place="margin">§. 62.</note> verse only that I suppose weight is lay'd upon. Though M. B. name the others, his <hi>Masters</hi> never do so. That of <hi>v.</hi> 33. seemes to deserve our notice in M. <hi>Biddles</hi> judgement, who changes the <hi>character</hi> of the words of it, for their significancy to his purpose. The words are: <hi>Thou shalt conceive in thy wombe, and bring forth a Sonne and shalt call his name Jesus; He shall be great, and shall be called the Sonne, of the Highest.</hi> What M. B. supposes may be proved from hence, at least how he would prove what he aimes at, I know not. That Jesus Christ, who was borne of the Virgin, was the <hi>Sonne of the Highest,</hi> we contend. On what account He was so, the place mentioneth not; but the reason of it is plentifully manifested in other places, as hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared.</p>
                  <p>The words of <hi>v.</hi> 35. are more generally managed by them. <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 63.</note>
                     <hi>overshadow thee; therefore also the holy Thing which shall be borne of thee shall be called the Sonne of God.</hi> But neither doe these particles, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, render a reason of Christs Filiation, nor are a note of the Consequen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, but only of an inference or consequence, that ensues from what he spake before. It being so as I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, <hi>even that holy Thing that shall be borne of thee shall be called the Sonne of God.</hi> There is weight also in that Expression: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: that <hi>Holy Thing, that shall be borne of thee.</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is not spoken in the <hi>concrete,</hi> or as an <hi>Adjective,</hi> but <hi>substantively,</hi> and points out the naturall Essence of Christ, whence he was that <hi>Holy thing.</hi> Besides, if this be the cause of Christs Filiation which is assigned, it must be demonstrated, that Christ was on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>called</hi> the Son of God; for so hath it been said, that He should be: but there is not any thing in the new Testament to give light, that ever Christ was on this account <hi>called</hi> the Sonne of God; nor can the Adversaries produce any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>That this Scripture is called to remembrance not at all to M. B's advantage will speedily appeare. For</p>

                     <hi>for What cause</hi> it is, that Christ is the Sonne of God: but only that He is so; He being expressed and spoken of, under that description which is used of him 20 times in that Gospel, <hi>He who is sent of the Father.</hi> This is all that is in this place asserted, that he whom the Father <hi>sanctifyed, and sent into the world,</hi> counted it no Robery to be equall <hi>with</hi> him, nor did blaspheme in calling himselfe his Sonne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is evident that Christ in these words asserts himselfe to be <note place="margin">§. 68.</note> such a Sonne of God, as the Jewes charged him with blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, for affirming of himselfe that he was. For He justifies himselfe aginst their accusation; Not denying in the least, that they <hi>rightly apprehended</hi> and understood him, but maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning what He had spoken to be most true.

                  <p>A briefe <hi>Analysis</hi> of this place will give evidence to this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words. Our Saviour Christ having given <note place="margin">§. 70.</note> the Reason, why the <hi>Jewes</hi> believed not on him, namely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they <hi>were not of his sheep, v.</hi> 26. describes thereupon both the nature of those Sheep of his <hi>v.</hi> 27. And their condition of <hi>safety v.</hi> 28. This he faerther confirmes from the Consideration of his Fathers greatnesse and power, which is amplifyed by the comparison of it with others, who are all lesse them He, <hi>v.</hi> 29. As also from his own Power and Will, which appeares to be sufficient for that end and purpose from his Essentiall unity with his Father, <hi>v.</hi> 30. The Effect of this discourse of Christ by Accident, is the <hi>Jewes taking up of stones,</hi> which is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifyed by this, that it was the second time they did so and that to this purpose, that they might stone him, <hi>v.</hi> 31.

                        </gap>,</hi> telling him that it was not for a good work, but for blasphemy, that he <hi>made himselfe to be God,</hi> whom they would prove to be but a <hi>man, v.</hi> 33. This pretence of <hi>Blasphemy</hi> Christ disproves (as I said before) by an Argment <hi>a mimori v.</hi> 35, 36. And with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Effects, or the workes which he did, which suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved him to be God, <hi>v.</hi> 27, 38.

                  <p n="4">4.

                     <hi>tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the Fathers, God hath fullfilled the same unto us, their Children, in that he hath raised up Jesus againe, as it is also written in the second Psalme, thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that can see in this Text, a cause assigned of the Filiation of Christ, that should relate to the <hi>Resurrection,</hi> I confesse is sharper sighted then I. This I know, that if Christ were made the Sonne of God by his <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the dead, <hi>He</hi> was not the <hi>Son of God who dyed,</hi> for that preceded <hi>this</hi> his <hi>making</hi> to be the Sonne of God. But that God <hi>gave his only begotten Son to dye,</hi> that he <hi>spared not</hi> his only Sonne, but gave him up to <hi>death,</hi> I think is cleare in Scripture, if any thing be so.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> seemes to interpret this place to me, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes <note place="margin">§. 73.</note> us, that <hi>Christ was declared to be the Son of God with Power, by the Resurrection from the dead, Rom.</hi> 1. 3. Not that he was made so, but he was declared, or made known to be so. When be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>crucifyed through weaknesse, he lived by the Power of God, 2 Cor.</hi> 13. 4. Which power also was his own, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 18.</p>
                  <p>According as was before intimated, <hi>Grotius</hi> interprets these <note place="margin">§. 74. <hi>Ego fili hodie te genui, id est regem te feci: hoc in Christo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletum, cum ei data omnis potestas in Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo &amp; in terra.</hi> Math. 28. 18. &amp;c.

                     </gap>. But then he was not the <hi>Son of God</hi> before his Resurrection: for he was the Sonne of God by his being <hi>begotten</hi> of him: which as it is false, so contrary to his own <hi>Glosse</hi> on <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 35. (2.) Christ was a <hi>King</hi> before his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> and owned himselfe so to be, as hath been shewed. (3.) <hi>Iustins</hi> words are suited to our exposition of this place: He was said to be then <hi>begotten,</hi> because then he was made <hi>known</hi> to be so the Sonne of God. (4.) That these words are not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to Christ in their first sence, in respect of Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from the preheminence assigned unto him above Angells by vertue of this expression, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. which he had before his death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. Nor (5.) Are the words here used to prove
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115372:134"/> the Resurrection, which is done in the verses following out of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> and another <hi>Psalme; And as concerning that he raised him from the dead &amp;c. v.</hi> 34. but then</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is not an interpretation of the meaning of that passage in the <hi>Psalme,</hi> which <hi>Paul Act.</hi> 13. insists on; but the proving that Christ was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as in that <hi>Psalme</hi> he was called, by his <hi>Resurrection from the dead:</hi> which was the great manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting cause of his Deity in the world.</p>
                  <p>What M. B. intends by the next place mentioned by him, I know not. It is <hi>Rev. 1. 5. And from Jesus Christ who is the faithfull witnesse, and the first begotten of the dead.</hi> That Christ was the <hi>first</hi> who was raised from the dead, to a <hi>blessed and glorious immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> and is thence called the <hi>first begotten</hi> of them, or <hi>from the dead,</hi> and that all that rise to such an immortallity, riseafter him, and by vertue of his Resurrection, is most certaine and granted; but that from thence he is that <hi>only begotten Son of God,</hi> though thereby he was only declared so to be, there is not the least tittle in the Text giving occasion to such an apprehension.</p>
                  <p>And the same also is affirmed of the following place of <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 18. where the same words are used againe. He is the head of the Church, who is the beginning, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>title of Lord, so with the title of God in the Scripture?</hi> Ans. <hi>Thomas saith my Lord, and my God.</hi> Verily, if <hi>Thomas</hi> said, that <hi>Christ was his God,</hi> and said <hi>true,</hi> M. B. is to <hi>blame,</hi> who denyes him to be God at all. With this one <hi>blast</hi> of the spirit of the Lord is his fine <hi>Fabrick</hi> of Religion blown to the ground. And it may be supposed, that M. B. made mention of this portion of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he might have the honour of <hi>cutting his own throat,</hi> and destroying his own cause; or rather, that God in his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgement hath forced him to open his mouth to his own shame. What ever be the cause of it, M. B. is very farre from escaping this sword of the Lord, either by his <hi>insinuation</hi> in the present <hi>Quere,</hi> or diversion in the following: For the present: it was not the intent of <hi>Thomas</hi> to <hi>dignify Christ with Titles,</hi> but to make a plaine <hi>Confession of his Faith,</hi> being called upon by Christ to <hi>believe.</hi> In this state he professes, that he believes him to be his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>his God. Thomas</hi> doubtlesse was a Christian; and M. B. tells us that Christians have <hi>but one God,</hi> 1. Chap: Qu. 1. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 6. Jesus Christ then being the <hi>God of Thomas,</hi> he is the Christians <hi>one God:</hi> if M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B. may be believed. It is not then the <hi>dignifying of Christ with Titles,</hi> which it is not for men to do, but the naked confession of a Believers Faith, that in these words is expressed. Christ is the Lord and God of a Believer; <hi>Ergo,</hi> the only true God; as 1 Joh: 5. 19. M. B. perhaps will tell you, he was made a God; so one Abomination begets another, Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Idolatry: of this afterward. But yet he was not according to his Companions made a God before his Ascention; which was not yet, when <hi>Thomas</hi> made his solemne Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>

                     <hi>Was he so the God of Thomas, as that He himselfe in the moane time, did not acknowledge another to be his God?</hi> Ans. Joh. 20. 17. Revel. 3. 12.</p>
                  <p>True, He who being partaker of the divine Essence, in the forme of God, was <hi>Thomas</hi> his God; as he was Mediatour, the head of his Church, interceding for them, acknowledged his <hi>Father</hi> to be <hi>his God.</hi> Yea God may be said to be <hi>his</hi> God, upon the account of his Sonship, and <hi>Personality,</hi> in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard he hath his Deity of his Father, and is <hi>God of God.</hi> Not that he is a <hi>secundary, lesser, made God, a Hero, Semideus,</hi> as M.

                  <p>Of the same nature is the last question, <hi>viz. Have you any passage in the Scripture, where Christ at the same time hath the Appellation</hi>

                     <hi>of God given to him, and is said to have a God?</hi> Ans. Heb. 1. 8, 9.</p>
                  <p>By M. B's favour, Christ is not said to <hi>have a God,</hi> thought God be said to be his God, 2. <hi>v.</hi> 8. Christ by M. <hi>Biddles</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession is expressly called God. He is then the <hi>one true</hi> God with the Father, or another: if the first, what doth he contend about? If the second, He is a God, that is not God by <hi>nature,</hi> that is, not the <hi>one</hi> God of Christians, and consequently an <hi>Idol</hi> &amp; indeed such is the Christ that M.

                  <p>Thus the close of this Chapter, through the good wise hand of the providence of God, leaving himselfe and his Truth not <note place="margin">§. 88.</note> without witnesse, hath produced instances, and evidences of the Truth opposed, abundantly sufficient, without farther enquiry and labour, to discover the <hi>sophistry</hi> and vanity of all M. <hi>Biddles</hi> former Queries, and insinuations; for which let him have the praise.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And this is all which these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> offer to make good their Assertion, that the Diety of Christ <hi>is repugnant to Right Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;</hi> which therefore upon what small <hi>pretence</hi> they have done, will quickly appeare.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is true, that there cannot be such a <hi>personall</hi> uniting of two <hi>substances</hi> with such diverse Properties, so as by that Union to make an Exequation, or an <hi>equalling</hi> of those diverse proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but that there may not be such a concurrence, and meeting of such different substances in one Person, both of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving entire to themselves their <hi>essentiall</hi> Properties, which are so <hi>diverse,</hi> there is nothing pleaded nor pretended.

               <p n="2">2.

So that insteed of pleading <hi>Reason,</hi> which they pretended they would, they do nothing in this first part of their Answer, but <hi>begge</hi> the thing in Question; which being of so much importance, and concernment to our Soules, is never like to be granted them on any such termes. Will, Christ on their entreaties, cease to be God?</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:115372:142"/>
               <p>Neither is their Second pretended Argument of any other kind. We deny, that the Humane Nature of Christ had any <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> such subsistence of its own, as to give it a <hi>proper personality,</hi> being from the time of its Conception, assumed into <hi>subsistence</hi> with the Son of God. This we prove by expresse Texts of Scripture, <hi>Isa: 7. 14. Chap: 9. 6. Ioh. 1. 14. Rom: 1. 3. Chap. 9. 5. Heb. 2. 15. Luk. 1. 35. Heb. 9. 14. Act. 3. 15. Act. 20. 28. Phil. 2. 7. 1 Cor. 2. 8. &amp;c.</hi> And by Arguments taken from the assigning of all the diverse Properties by them mentioned before, and sundry others, to the same person of Christ, &amp;c. That we would take it for granted, that this cannot be, is the modest <hi>Request</hi> of these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> with whom we have to do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If by <hi>natures constituting Persons,</hi> they meane those, who <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> antecedently to their union, have actually done so, we grant they cannot meet in one Person; so that upon this union they should cease to be two Persons. The personality of either of them being destroyed, their different Beings could not be preserved. But if by <hi>constituting,</hi> they understand only that which is so in <hi>potentia,</hi> or a <hi>next possibility</hi> of constituting a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; then, as before, they only begge of us, that we would not believe, that the <hi>Person</hi> of the <hi>Word</hi> did assume the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ, that <hi>holy thing, that was borne of the Virgin,</hi> into subsistence with it selfe; which for the Reasons before mentioned, and others like to them, we cannot grant.</p>
               <p>And this is the substance of all that these men plead, and <note place="margin">§. 12.</note> make a noyse with in the world, in an opposition to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Deity of the Sonne of God. This <hi>Pretence</hi> of Reason, (which evidently comes short of being any thing else) is their shield &amp; buckler in the cause they have unhappily undertaken. When they tell us of Christs being <hi>hungry,</hi> and <hi>dying,</hi> we say, it was in the humane nature, wherein he was obnoxious to such things no lesse then we, being therein <hi>made like unto us in all things, sinne only excepted.</hi> When of his <hi>submission and subjection</hi> to his Father, we tell them it is in respect of the <hi>Office</hi> of Mediatour, which he willingly undertook; and that his <hi>Inequality</hi> unto him, as to that Office, doth noe way prejudice his <hi>Equality</hi> with him, in respect of his nature and Being. But when with Scriptures, and Arguments from thence, as cleare and convincing, as if they were written with the <hi>beames of the Sunne,</hi>
                  <pb n="199" facs="tcp:115372:142"/> we prove our deare Lord Jesus in respect of a divine nature whereof he was partaker from Eternity, to be God blessed for ever: they tell us it cannot be, that two such diverse natures, as those of God and man, should be united in one person: and it cannot be so, because it cannot be so, there is no such union among other things. And these <hi>things must be,</hi> that those who are <hi>approved may be tryed:</hi> but let us heare them out. <note place="margin">§. 13.</note>

                  <hi>A.</hi>
                  <q>That here is a very great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.

But the soule and body are in that manner conjoyned in man, that a man is neither soule nor body, nor neither soule nor body do singly of themselves constitute a person. But as the divine nature by its selfe constitutes a person, so it is necessary that the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature should do.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>R.</hi> In what sence it may be said, that Christ, that is, the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> consisteth of a divine &amp; humane nature, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore declared. The <hi>Person</hi> of the Sonne of God assumed the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature</hi> into subsistence with it selfe, and both, in that one Person are Christ.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If our <hi>Catechists</hi> have no more to say to the illustration given to the Union of the <hi>two Natures</hi> in the Person of Christ, by that of the soule and body in one humane person, but that there is a <hi>great difference</hi> in something btween them, they doe but <hi>filch</hi> away the <hi>graines</hi> that are allowed to every similitude; and shew wherein the <hi>compara<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s</hi> differ, but answer not to that wherein they do agree.</p>
               <p n="3">3. All that is intended by this <hi>similitude,</hi> is to shew, that besides the change of things, one into another, either by the losse of one, as of <hi>water into wine</hi> by Christ, and besides the <hi>Ʋnion</hi> that is in <hi>Physicall Generation</hi> by mixture, whereby, and from whence, some <hi>third</hi> thing ariseth, that also there is a <hi>substantiall union,</hi>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:115372:143"/> whereby one thing is not <hi>turned</hi> into another, nor mixed with it. And the end of using this <hi>similitude,</hi> (which to please our <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chists</hi> we can forbeare, acknowledging, that there is not among created beings any thing that can fully represent this, which we confesse <hi>without controversy to be a great mystery)</hi> is only to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the folly of that assertion of their Master on <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. that if the <hi>word be made flesh</hi> in our sence, it must be turned into flesh; for saith he, one thing cannot be <hi>made</hi> another, but <hi>by change, conversion, and mutation into it.</hi> The Absurdity of which assertion is sufficiently evinced, by the substantiall union of <hi>soule and body,</hi> made one person, without that alteration and change of their natures which is pleaded for. Neither is the <hi>word</hi> made flesh by <hi>Alteration,</hi> but by Union.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is confessed, that the <hi>soule</hi> is not said to be <hi>made</hi> the body, nor the body said to be <hi>made</hi> the soule, as the <hi>word</hi> is said to be <hi>made flesh;</hi> for the union of soule and body, is not an union of distinct substances, subsisting in one common <hi>subsistence,</hi> but a union of <hi>two</hi> parts of one nature, wherereof the one is the forme of the other. And herein is the <hi>dissimilitude</hi> of that <hi>similitude.</hi> Hence will that <hi>predication</hi> be justified in Christ; the <hi>word was made flesh,</hi> without any change or alteration, because of that subsistence whereunto the <hi>flesh,</hi> or <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ was assumed, which is common to them both. And so it is in <hi>accidentall</hi> predications. When we say a <hi>man is made white, black, or pale,</hi> we do not intend that He is, as to his <hi>substance,</hi> changed into <hi>whitenesse &amp;c.</hi> but that he who is a <hi>man,</hi> is also become <hi>white.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is true that the <hi>soule</hi> is not a person, nor the body; but a Person is the <hi>Exurgency</hi> of their conjunction; and therefore we do not say, that herein the similitude is urged; for the divine nature of Christ had its own <hi>personality</hi> antecedent to this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: nor is the union of his Person, the union of severall parts of the same nature, but the Concurrence of severall natures in one subsistence.</p>
               <p n="6">6. That 'tis of necessity that Christs <hi>humane nature should of its selfe constitute a person,</hi> is urged upon the old account of begg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing in question. This is that which in the case of Christ we deny; &amp; produce all the proofes before mentioned to make evident the Reason of our deny all. But our great <hi>Masters</hi>
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:115372:143"/> here, say the contrary; and our <hi>under-Catechists</hi> are resolved to believe them. Christ was a <hi>true man,</hi> because he had the true <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> of a man, soule and body, with all their essentiall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. A peculiar personality belongeth not to the essence of a man, but to his existence in <hi>such</hi> a manner. Neither do we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Christ to have a <hi>person, as a Man,</hi> but an <hi>humane Person.</hi> For the humane nature of Christ <hi>subsisteth</hi> in that, which thought it be in it selfe divine, yet as to that act of sustentation, which it gives the humane nature, it is the subsistence of a man. On which account the <hi>subsistence</hi> of the humane nature of Christ is made more <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> then that of any other man whatever. And this is the whole plea of our <hi>Catechists</hi> from Reason, that whereto they so much pretend, and which they give the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence unto, in their attempts against the Deity of Christ, as the chiefe, if not the only, engine they have to work by. And if they be thus <hi>weake</hi> in the <hi>maine body</hi> of their <hi>forces,</hi> certainly that reserve which they pretend from Scripture, whereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they have the meanest <hi>pretence</hi> and shew, that ever any of the sonnes of men had, who were necessitated to make a plea from them, in a matter of so great concernment, as that now under consideration, will quickly disappeare. Thus then they proceed.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi>
                  <q>First, because that the Scripture propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth to us, one only God by nature, whom we have above declared to be the Father of Christ. Secondly, the same Scripture testifieth, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ was by nature a man, whereby it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth from him any divine nature. 3. Because what ever divine thing Christ hath, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainly teacheth that he had it by a gift of the Father; <hi>Mat: 28. 18. Phil: 2. 9. 1 Cor: 15. 27. Ioh.</hi> 5. 19. 10. 25. Lastly, because the same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture most evidently shewing, that Jesus Christ did not vindicate and ascribe all his divine works to himselfe, or to any divine nature of his own, but to his Father, makes it plaine, that
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115372:144"/> that divine nature in Christ was altogether in vaine, and would have been without any cause.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And this is that which our Catechists have to pretend from Scripture against the Diety of Christ, concluding, that any such divine nature in him would be <hi>superfluous and needlesse,</hi> themselves being Judges. In the strength of what here they have urged, they set themselves to evade the Evidence of neare <hi>fifty expresse Texts of Scripture,</hi> by themselves produced, and insisted on, giving undeniable Testimony to the truth they oppose. Let then what they have brought forth be briefly considered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture doth indeed propose unto us <hi>one only God by</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 15.</note>
                  <hi>nature,</hi> and we confesse, that that only true God, is the <hi>Father of our Lord Jesus Christ;</hi> but we say, that the Sonne is partaker of the Fathers nature, of the same nature with him, as being his <hi>proper Sonne,</hi> and by his own Testimony <hi>one with him.</hi> He is such a Son, (as hath been declared) as is begotten of the <hi>Essence</hi> of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and is therefore <hi>God blessed for ever.</hi> If the Father be God by nature, so is the Sonne, for he is of the same nature with the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To conclude that Christ is not <hi>God,</hi> because he is <hi>man,</hi> is plainly and evidently to <hi>begge</hi> the thing in Question. We evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently demonstrate in the person of Christ, Properties that are <hi>inseperable Adjuncts</hi> of a divine nature, and such also, as no lesse properly belong to an humane nature: from the asserting of the one of these, to conclude to a deniall of the other, is to <hi>beg</hi> that which they are not able to <hi>digge</hi> for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a twofold communication of the Father to the Sonne; 1. By <hi>Eternall Generation,</hi> so the Sonne receives his <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality,</hi> and therein his Divine nature, from him, who said unto him, <hi>Thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee:</hi> and this is so farre from disproving the Deity of Christ, that it abundantly confirmes it: and this is mentioned, <hi>Ioh:</hi> 5. 19, 20, 21, 22. This Christ hath by nature. 2. By Collation of <hi>Gifts, Honour</hi> and <hi>Dignity, Exaltation,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> upon him as Mediatour, or in respect of that Office, which he humbled himselfe to undergoe,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115372:144"/> and for the full execution whereof, an investiture with Glory, Honour, and Power, was needfull, which is mentioned, <hi>Math: 28. 18. Phil: 2. 9. 1 Cor:</hi> 15. 27. which is by no means derogatory to the <hi>Deity</hi> of the Sonne; for <hi>inequality</hi> in respect of Office is well consistent with <hi>Equality</hi> in respect of nature. This Christ hath by Grace. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18. Christ speaks of himselfe as throughly furnished with <hi>Authority,</hi> for the accomplishing of the worke of <hi>Mediation,</hi> which he had undertaken. It is of his Office, not of his Nature, or Essence that he speaks. <hi>Phil:</hi> 2. 9. Christ is said to be <hi>exalted,</hi> which he was in respect of the <hi>Reall</hi> Exaltation given to his Humane Nature, and the manifestation of the <hi>Glory</hi> of his Divine, which he had with his Father before the World was, but had eclipsed for a season: 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 15. 27. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the same Exaltation of Christ as before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is false, that Christ doth not ascribe the <hi>divine workes</hi> which he wrought, to himselfe, and his own <hi>divine</hi> Power, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that he often also make mention of the Father, as by whose Appointment he wrought those workes, as Mediator. <hi>Ioh. 5. 17.

That it is sufficient for the disproving of their <hi>hypothesis</hi> concerning Christ, if we prove him to have been <hi>existent</hi> before his Incarnation, whether the Testimonies whereby we prove it, reach expressly to the proofe of his Eternity or no.

               <p n="2">2.

               <p n="3">3. That the whole of our Argument from this place, is very farre from consisting in that Expression, <hi>in the beginning,</hi> though that, relating to the matter whereof the Apostle treates, doth evidently evince the truth pleaded for. It is part of our <hi>Catechists</hi> trade, so to <hi>divide</hi> the words of Scripture, that their maine import and tendence, may not be perceived. In one place they answer to the first words, in the <hi>beginning:</hi> in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to, he <hi>was with God,</hi> and <hi>he was God;</hi> in a third to that, <hi>all things were made by him;</hi> in a fourth, (all at a great distance one from another) to, <hi>the Word was made flesh:</hi> Which desperate: course of proceeding, argues that their cause is also desperate, and that they durst not meet this one Testimony as by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost placed and ordered for the confirmation of our Faith,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:115372:146"/> without such a bold mangling of the Text, as that instanced in.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I shall then insist upon the whole of this Testimony, as <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> the words are placed in their Contexture by the Holy Ghost, <note place="margin">Novum Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitus oblatum aperio. aliud agenti exhibet se mihi adspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu primo augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stissimum illud caput Johannis Evangelistae &amp; Apostoli. <hi>In principio erat verbum.</hi> Lego partem capitis, &amp; ita commoveor legens, ut repente divinitatem Argumenti, &amp; scripti majestatem, autoritatem{que} sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serim, longo intervallo omnibus eloquentiae humanae viribus praeeuntem.

                  </note> and vindicate them from what in severall places they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted against severall parcels of them. Thus then from these words, (these divine words (whose very reading reclaimed as eminent a <hi>Schollar</hi> as the world enjoyed any in his dayes, from <hi>Atheisme</hi>) we proceed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that <hi>was in the beginning,</hi> before the creation of the world, before <hi>any thing,</hi> of all things that <hi>are made, was made,</hi> Who was <hi>then with God, and was God,</hi> Who <hi>made all things, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out whom nothing was made,</hi> in whom <hi>was Life,</hi> He is <hi>God</hi> by nature blessed for ever; nor is there in the whole Scripture a more glorious, and eminent description of God, by his Attributes, name, and Workes, then here is given of him concerning whom all these things are spoken; but now all this is expressly affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the <hi>Word that was made flesh,</hi> that is confessedly of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> therefore he is God by nature blessed for ever. Unto the <hi>severall</hi> parts of this plaine and evident Testimony, in <hi>severall</hi> places they except <hi>severall</hi> things, thinking thereby to evade that strength and Light, which each part yeilds to other, as they lye, and all of them to the whole; I shall consider them in order as they come to hand.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Against that expression, <hi>in the beginning,</hi> they except in <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> the place mentioned above, that it doth not <hi>signify preeternity, which hath no beginning.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="1">1. This imped's not at all the <hi>Existence</hi> of Jesus Christ before the <hi>Creation,</hi> although it denys, that his Eternity is expressly asserted. Now to affirme, that Christ did <hi>exist</hi> before the whole Creation, and <hi>made all things,</hi> doth no lesse prove him to be <hi>no more a Creature,</hi> but the Eternall God, then the most expresse Testimony of his Eternity doth, or can do.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:115372:147"/>2. Though Eternity have no <hi>beginning,</hi> and the sence of these words cannot be, in <hi>the beginning of Eternity,</hi> yet Eternity is before all things, and <hi>in the beginning</hi> may be the description of <hi>Eternity,</hi> as it is plainly, <hi>Prov. 8. 23. From everlasting, and in the beginning before the Earth was,</hi> are of the same import. And the Scripture saying, that <hi>in the beginning the word was,</hi> not, <hi>was made,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 17. 5.</note> doth as evidently expresse Eternity, as it doth in those other phrases, of, <hi>before the world was,</hi> or <hi>before the foundation of the world,</hi> which more then once it insists on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. By <hi>in the beginning,</hi> is intended before the <hi>Creation of all things.</hi> What will it availe our <hi>Catechists,</hi> if it doth not expressly denote Eternity? Why, the <hi>word beginning is to be interpreted vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, according to the subject matter spoken of, as Gen. 1. 1. which being here the Gospell, it is the beginning of the Gospell that is intended.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be it agreed, that the word <hi>beginning</hi> is to be understood according to <hi>the subject matter,</hi> whereunto it is applyed; that the Apostle doth <hi>firstly,</hi> and <hi>nextly</hi> treat of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> as to the season of its preaching, is most absurd. He treats evidently and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessedly of the <hi>Person</hi> of the Author of the Gospell, of the <hi>Word</hi> that was <hi>God,</hi> and was made flesh. And that this cannot be wrested to the sence intended, is cleare; For 1. the Apostle evidently alludes to the first words of <hi>Genesis: in the beginning God created Heaven and earth:</hi> and the <hi>Syriack Translatour</hi> from the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> here places <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: so here, in the <hi>beginning the word made all things.</hi> 2. The following words, the <hi>word was with God,</hi> manifests the intendment of the Holy Ghost to be, to declare <hi>what,</hi> and where the <hi>Word,</hi> was, before the Creation of the world, even <hi>with God.</hi> 3. The Testimony that he <hi>was God in the beginning,</hi> will no way agree with this glosse: take his <hi>being God</hi> in <hi>their</hi> sence, yet they deny, that he was God <hi>in the beginning</hi> of the Gospell, or <hi>before his suffering,</hi> as hath been shewed. 4. The sence given by the <hi>Socinians</hi> to this place is indeed senselesse. <hi>In the beginning</hi> (say they) that is, <hi>when the Gospell began to be preached by John Baptist,</hi> (which is plainly said to be, before the world was made) <hi>the word, or the man Jesus Christ</hi> (the Word being afterwards said to be made <hi>flesh,</hi> after this whole description of him, as the Word) <hi>was wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:115372:147"/> to <hi>Simeon, Anna,</hi> and to others) and <hi>the word was God,</hi> that is, <hi>God appointed, that he should be so afterwards, or made God</hi> (though it be said, he was God, then, when he was with God) and <hi>all things</hi> were made by him; the <hi>new Creature was made by him,</hi> or the world by his preaching, and teaching, and working Miracles was made, or <hi>reformed;</hi> (that is, <hi>something was mended by him,</hi>) such Interpretations we may at any time be supplyed withall at an easy rate. 5. To view it a little farther. <hi>In the beginning,</hi> that is, <hi>when John preached Jesus, and said, behold the Lamb of God; was the word;</hi> or Jesus was, that is, He was, when <hi>John preached</hi> that he was: <hi>egregiam vero laudem!</hi> He was, when he was. <hi>The word was in the beginning:</hi> that is, Jesus was flesh and bloud, and then was afterwards <hi>made flesh,</hi> and <hi>dwelt amongst us,</hi> when he had dwelt amongst us. And this is that interpretation which <hi>Faustus Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> receiving from his Uncle <hi>Laelius</hi> first set up upon; in the strength whereof he went forth unto all the Abominations which afterwards he so studiously vented.</p>
               <p>Passing by those two weighty &amp; most material passages of this <note place="margin">§. 22.</note> Testimony, <hi>the word was God,</hi> and the <hi>word was with God,</hi> the one evidencing his <hi>onenesse of nature</hi> with, and the other his <hi>distinctnesse</hi> of Personality from his Father, our <hi>Catechists</hi> after an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of neare 20 <hi>pages,</hi> fix upon the 3. <hi>verse,</hi> and attempt to pervert the expresse words and intendment of it, having cut it off from its dependance on what went before, that evidently gives light into the aime of the Holy Ghost therein: their words concerning this verse are;</p>

                  </note> Declare to me with what Testimonies they contend to prove, that Christ created the Heavens and the Earth?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>With those, where it is written, that by him all things, and without him was nothing made, that was made, and the world was made by him:</q>
                  <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 3, 10. as also <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. and 10, 11, 12. <hi>verses.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how dost thou answer to the first Testimony?</p>
               <p n="1">1. <q>It is not in the first Testimony: they were created, but they were made. 2. <hi>Iohn</hi> saies, they were made by him; which manner of speaking doth not expresse him, who is the first cause of any thing, but the second or mediate cause. Lastly, the word al things, is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:115372:148"/> not taken for all things universally, but is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together related to the subject matter, which is most frequent in the Scriptures, especially of the new Testament, whereof there is a singular example, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. Wherein there is a discourse of a thing very like to this, whereof <hi>Iohn</hi> treates, where it is said; all things are made new; whenas it is certaine, that there are many things which are not made new: Now whereas the subject matter in <hi>Iohn</hi> is the Gospell, it appeareth, that this word all things, is to be received only of all those things which belong to the Gospell?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But why doth Iohn adde, that without him nothing was made, that was made?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> added these words, that he might the better illustrate those before spoken, all things were made by him; which seeme to import, that all those things were made by the word, or Sonne of God, although some of them, and those of great moment, were of such sort, as were not done by him, but the Apostles. As the calling of the Gentiles, the abolishing of Legall ceremonies. For although these things had their originall from the preaching, and workes of the Lord Jesus, yet they were not perfected by Christ himselfe, but by his Apostles; but yet not without him. For the Apostles administred all things in his name, &amp; authority, as the Lord himselfe said, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me ye can do nothing, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. 5.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus to the 3. <hi>verse,</hi> of which afterwards. We shall quickly <note place="margin">§. 24.</note> see how these men are put to their shifts, to escape the sword of this witnesse, which stands in the way <hi>to cut them off</hi> in their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to curse the Church and People of God, by denying the Deity of their blessed Saviour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Connexion of the words is wholly omitted, <hi>He was
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:115372:148"/> God, and he was in the beginning with God, and all things were made by him.</hi> The words are an illustration of his divine nature, by his divine power and workes: He was God, and he made <hi>all things.</hi> He that made all things is God: <hi>Heb. 3. 4. The Word made all things, Ioh.</hi> 1. 3. therefore he is God. Let us see what is answered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is not said, they were created by him, but made.</hi> But the word <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> here used by <hi>Iohn,</hi> is the same, that in sundry places the <hi>Septuagint</hi> (whom the writers of the New Testament followed) used about the creation. As <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: and if, as it is affirmed, he was in the Beginning (<hi>before</hi> all things) and <hi>made</hi> them all, he made them out of nothing; that is, he <hi>created</hi> them. To <hi>create</hi> is but to produce <hi>something</hi> out of nothing, Nothing supplying the' <hi>terme from whence</hi> of their production. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>They are said to be made by him:</hi> its <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which denotes not the principall, but mediate, or instrumentall cause.</p>
               <p>But it is most evident, that these men <hi>care not what</hi> they say, so they may say <hi>something,</hi> that they think will trouble them whom they oppose.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This might helpe the <hi>Arians,</hi> who fancyed Christ to be <hi>created,</hi> or made before all other things; and to have been the <hi>instrumentall cause,</hi> whereby God created all other things; but how this concernes them to insist on, who deny that Christ had any Existence at all, before the world was some thousands of yeares old, is not easy to be apprehended.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In their own sence this is not to the purpose, but express<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contradictory to what they offer in the last place, by way of answer to the latter part of the third verse. Here they say, <hi>He is not the principall efficient cause,</hi> but the second, and mediate: there, that all things were either <hi>done</hi> by him, or in his <hi>Name,</hi> &amp; <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity:</hi> which certainly denotes the principall cause of the thing done.

               <p n="1">1. This is meerely <hi>begged: Iohn</hi> speakes not one word of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> as such; gives no description of it, its nature, or Effects: but evidently, plainly, and directly speakes of the <hi>Word,</hi> that was <hi>God,</hi> and that made <hi>all things,</hi> describing him in his <hi>Eternity,</hi> his <hi>Workes,</hi> his <hi>Incarnation,</hi> his <hi>Imployment,</hi> his <hi>Comming</hi> into the World and his <hi>businesse:</hi> and treats of the Gospell, or the declaration, of the Will of God by Jesus Christ, distinctly afterwards, from verse 14. and forwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the expression, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17. all things are become new:</hi> it <note place="margin">§. 26.</note> is expressely restrained to the <hi>new Creature,</hi> to them <hi>that are in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ;</hi> but as to this generall expression here, there is no co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour why it should be so restrained. The Expression it selfe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where signifying the Creation of all things; see <hi>Gen. 2. 1, 2. Psal. 33. 6. Psal. 121. 2. Isa.</hi> 37. 16.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The other Expression, they say, is added, to manifest, <hi>that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 27.</note>
                  <hi>what was done after by the Apostles, was not done without him: and that is the meaning of these words, and without him was nothing made, that was made.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Their <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of referring the whole passage to the description of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> whereof there is not the least tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, nor intimation in the Text, being removed out of the way, this following figment falls of it selfe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Glosse is expressely contrary to the Text. The <hi>all things</hi> here mentioned, are the <hi>all things</hi> that were <hi>made</hi> in the <hi>Beginning</hi> of the World; but this Glosse referres it to the things made in the <hi>End</hi> of the World.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>contradictory</hi> to its selfe; for by the <hi>beginning,</hi> they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the <hi>beginning of the Gospell,</hi> at the first preaching of it; but the things, that they say here were made by Christ, are things that were done after his Assension.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is true, the Apostles wrought not any miracles, effected
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:115372:149"/> no mighty workes, but by the presence of Christ with them, (though the Text cited to prove it <hi>Ioh:</hi> 15. 5. be quite of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther importance, as speaking of <hi>Gospell obedience,</hi> not <hi>Workes of Miracles,</hi> or <hi>Conversions</hi>) but that those works of <hi>theirs,</hi> or his by them, are here intended, is not offer'd to proof by our <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chists.</hi> And this is the sence of the words they give; <hi>Christ, in the beginning of the Gospell, made all things; or all things were made by him; even those, which he made by others, after his Assension into heaven:</hi> or thus: (<hi>All things) that is, some things, (were made) that is, mended, (by him) that is, the Apostles, (in the beginning of the Gospell) that is, after his Assension.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:115372:150"/> to the Angells, of which we speake: but he had no where spoken of it, but Chap. 1. 6.

Where seeing it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that he speaks of that world, into which Jesus being entred, was made our Priest, as all the circumstances demonstrate, it appears, that he speaks not of the present, but of the world to come, seeing Chap. 8. v. 4. he had said of Christ, if he were on earth he should not be a Priest.</q>

               <p>The two First Exceptions have been already cashiered: those which follow are of as little weight or consideration. For</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. speaks not of the <hi>World to come;</hi> nor is there any place in the Scripture, where the word <hi>World</hi> doth signify <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,</hi> or the World to come, nor any thing looking that way. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 5. mention is made not <hi>simply</hi> of the World, but of the <hi>World to come;</hi> nor doth that expression of the Apostle relate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that of Chap. 1. 6. where the word <hi>World</hi> is used, but to what goes before, and after in the same Chapter, where the thing it selfe is insisted on, in other termes.

                  </note> But what dost thou understand by these words, the World was made by him?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>A twofold sence may be given of them; 1. That humane kind was reformed by Christ, and as it were made againe, because he brought life, and that eternall to humane kind, which was lost, and was subject to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall death; (which also <hi>John</hi> upbraideth the World withall, which being vindicated by Christ from destruction, acknowledged him not, but contemn'd and rejected him) for that is the manner of the Hebrew speech, that in such termes of speaking, the words, to <hi>make,</hi> and <hi>create,</hi> are as much as to make againe, or to create againe, because that tongue wants those words, that are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed compounds. The latter sence is, that that immortality which we expect, is, as to us,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:115372:151"/> made by Christ; as the same is called the world to come, in respect of us, although it be present to Christ, and the Angells.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That these expositions are destructive to one another is evident: and yet which of them to adhere unto our <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chists</hi> know not: such good builders are they, for to establish men in the Faith. Pull down they will, though they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to offer in the roome of what they endeavour to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the <hi>latter sence</hi> is not intended, was before evin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The world, that was <hi>made</hi> in the <hi>Beginning,</hi> into which Christ <hi>came,</hi> in which he <hi>was,</hi> which <hi>knew him not,</hi> which is said to be <hi>made,</hi> is a World: is not <hi>immortallity,</hi> or <hi>life eternall;</hi> nor is there any thing in the Context, that should in the least give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to such an absurd glosse.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Much lesse is the first sence of the words tolerable: for</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is expressly contradictory to the Text. He <hi>made the world;</hi> that is, <hi>he reformed it,</hi> and <hi>the world knew him not;</hi> when the world is not <hi>reformed,</hi> but by the <hi>knowledge</hi> of him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>be made,</hi> doth no where simply signify to be <hi>renewed,</hi> or <hi>reformed,</hi> unlesse it be joyned with other expressions, restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning its significancy to such Renovation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The <hi>world</hi> was not <hi>renewed</hi> by Christ whilst he was <hi>in it:</hi> nor can it be said to be <hi>renewed</hi> by him, only on the account of laying the foundation of its Renovation in his Doctrine. <hi>By him the world was made,</hi> that is, <hi>He preached that Doctrine, whereby some in the world were to be reformed.</hi> The world that Christ made <hi>knew him not:</hi> but the renewed world <hi>know him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Hebraisme</hi> of <hi>making,</hi> for <hi>reforming,</hi> is commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; without any instance for its confirmation. <hi>John</hi> wrote in <hi>Greeke,</hi> which language abounds with <hi>compositions</hi> above any other in the world, and such as on all occasions he makes use of.</p>
               <p>There is one passage more, that gives strength to the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> insisted on, confirming the existence of Christ in his divine nature, antecedently to his Incarnation, and that is <hi>v. 14. The word was made flesh. Who</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> is, and <hi>what,</hi> we have heard.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:115372:151"/> He who <hi>was in the beginning,</hi> who <hi>was God,</hi> and was <hi>with God,</hi> who made <hi>all things,</hi> who made <hi>the world,</hi> in <hi>whom was Light, and Life,</hi> He was <hi>made flesh.</hi> Flesh, so as that thereupon he dwelt <hi>amongst men,</hi> and conversed with them. How he was, and how he was said to be made flesh, I have declared in the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his eternall Sonship, and shall not againe insist thereon. This after the interposition of sundry <hi>Questions</hi> our <hi>Catechists</hi> take thus into consideration.</p>
               <p>How do they prove Christ to have been incarnate?</p>
               <p>

                     </note> to their translation it is read, <hi>the Word was made flesh,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How dost thou answer it?</p>
               <p>
                  <q>On this account, because in that Testimony, it is not said (as they speake) God was incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, or the divine nature assumed the humane. The Word was made flesh, is one thing, and God was Incarnate, or the divine nature assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the humane, another. Besides, these words, the word was made flesh, or rather, the speech was made flesh, may, and ought to be rendred, the word was Flesh. That it may be so rendred, appeares from the Testimonyes, in which the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (which is here translated) <hi>was made,</hi> is found rendred by the word, <hi>was:</hi> as in this <hi>chap. v.</hi> 6. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 24. 19. &amp;c. Also that it ought to be so rendred, the order of <hi>Iohns</hi> words teacheth, who should have spoken very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently, the word was made Flesh, that is, as our <hi>Adversaries</hi> interpret it, the Divine nature as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed the Humane, after he had spoken those things of the word, which followed the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the man Christ Jesus, such as are these: <hi>Iohn</hi> beare witnesse of him: he came into the world: he was not received of his own: that
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:115372:152"/> to them that received him, he gave Power to become the Sonnes of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the last plea they use in this case; the dying groanes of their perishing cause are in it: which will provide them nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with succour, nor reliefe. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is not <hi>Words,</hi> or Expressions, that we contend about. Grant the thing pleaded for, and we will not contend with any living about the expressions, wherein it is by any man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered. By the <hi>Incarnation of the Son of God,</hi> and by the <hi>Divine nature assuming the humane,</hi> we intend no more then what is here asserted, the Word, <hi>who was God, was made flesh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. All they have to plead to the thing insisted on, is, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>may,</hi> yea ought to be translated, <hi>fuit,</hi> WAS, and not <hi>factus est, was made.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="1">1. Suppose it should be translated WAS, what would it availe them? He that <hi>was</hi> a man, was <hi>made</hi> a man. In that sence it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses what he was, but withall denotes how he came so to be. He who <hi>was</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> before, <hi>was</hi> also a man; let them shew us any other way, how he <hi>became so,</hi> but only by being <hi>made so,</hi> and upon a supposition of this new <hi>Translation,</hi> they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine something. But</p>
               <p n="2">2. How will they prove, that so much as it MAY be rendred by <hi>fuit, was.</hi> They tell you it is so in two other places in the New Testament; but doth that prove that it <hi>may</hi> so much as be so rendred here? The proper sence, and common usage of it, is, <hi>was made;</hi> and because it is once or twice used in a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>sence, may</hi> it be so rendred here, where nothing requires, that it be turned aside from its most usuall acceptation; yea much enforcing it thereunto,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That it ought to be rendered by <hi>fuit, was,</hi> they plead the mentioning before of things done after Christs <hi>Incarnation</hi> (as we call it,) so that it cannot be, he <hi>was made flesh:</hi> but</p>
               <p n="1">1. Will they say, that this order is observed by the Apostle, that that which is first done, is first expressed, as to all particulars? What then becomes of their interpretation, who say the Word was made God by his <hi>Exaltation:</hi> and made <hi>flesh</hi> in his <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and yet how much is that, which in their sence was last,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115372:152"/> expressed before that which went before it? Or will they say, in <hi>him was the life of man,</hi> before he was <hi>made flesh?</hi> When the life of man, according to them, depends on his resurrection solely, which was after he ceased to be flesh in their sence. Or what conscience have these men, that in their disputes will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that to the interpretation of others, which they must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and imbrace for the establishing of their own?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Order of the words is most proper; <hi>Iohn</hi> having <note place="margin">§. 32.</note> asserted the Deity of Christ, with some generall concomitants and consequences of the dispensation, wherein he undertakes to be a Mediatour; in his 14. <hi>verse</hi> enters particularly upon a description of his entrance upon his Employment, and his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it on in, by the Revelation of the Will of God; so that without either difficulty or straining, the sence and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Holy Ghost falls in clearely in the words.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It it is evident, that the Word neither <hi>may,</hi> nor ought to to be translated according to their desire. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. It being so often said before, that the Word <hi>was,</hi> the Word is still <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: in the beginning the Word <hi>was,</hi> and the Word <hi>was</hi> God, and the Word <hi>was</hi> with God: The same <hi>was; he was in the world,</hi> he <hi>was</hi> the light; still the same word; so that if no more were intended, but what was before expressed, the termes would not be changed without excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly obscuring the sence; and therefore <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> must signify somewhat more then <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> applyed to other things in this very place, denotes their making, or their Originall, which our <hi>Catechists</hi> did not question in the Consideration of the places where it is so used; as <hi>v. 3. all things were made</hi> by him, and without him was nothing <hi>made,</hi> that <hi>was made,</hi> and <hi>v. 10. the world was made by him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This phrase is expounded accordingly in other places; as <hi>Rom. 1. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </note> who is therefore called <hi>sermo</hi> by Iohn, was a man subject to all miseries, and afflictions, and lastly to death it selfe. For the Scripture useth the word Flesh in that sence, as is cleare from those places, where God speakes, my Spirit shall not alwayes contend with man, seeing he is Flesh, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. and Peter, all Flesh is grasse. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24.</p>
               <p>This is the upshot of our Catechists exposition of this first Chapter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as to the Person of Christ. Which is</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Absurd,</hi> upon their own suppositions, for the Testimonies produced affirme <hi>every man to be flesh;</hi> so that to say he is a man, is to say he is flesh: and to say that <hi>man was flesh,</hi> is to say that a <hi>man was a man,</hi> in as much as every man is flesh.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>False,</hi> and no way fitted to the intendment of the Holy Ghost; for He was <hi>made Flesh</hi> antecedently to his <hi>dwelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst</hi> us; which immediately followes in the Text: Nor is his <hi>being made flesh</hi> suited to any thing in this place, but his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with men, which answers his Incarnation, not his mediation; neither is this Exposition confirmed by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance from the Scriptures, of the like expression used concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Jesus Christ; as that we urge is, <hi>Rom. 1. 3.

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115372:153"/> he was before.</hi> What we intend from hence, and the force of the Argument from this Testimony insisted on, will the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, if we adde unto it those <hi>other</hi> places of Scripture, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the same thing is more expresly, and <hi>emphatically</hi> affirmed, which our <hi>Catechists</hi> cast (or some of them) quite into another place, on pretence of the <hi>method</hi> wherein they proceed, indeed to take off from the evidence of the Testimony, as they dealt with what we plead from <hi>John</hi> the first: the places I intend are</p>
               <p>Joh. 3. 13. <hi>And no man hath assended up to Heaven, but he that came down from Heaven, even the Sonne of man, who is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Vers. 31. <hi>He that cometh from above, is above all. He that cometh from Heaven, is above all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>John 8. 23. <hi>Ye are from beneath, I am am from above.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Joh. 16. 28. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world; and againe I leave the world, and go to the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence we thus argue. He that <hi>was in Heaven</hi> before he <hi>was on the earth,</hi> &amp; who was <hi>also</hi> in <hi>Heaven, whilst</hi> he was on the earth, is the Eternall God. But this doth Jesus Christ abundantly confirme concerning himselfe; therefore he is the <hi>Eternall God</hi> blessed for ever.</p>
               <p>In answer to the first place our Catechists thus proceed. <note place="margin">§. 36.</note>

                  </note> What answerest thou to the second Testimony, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 62.</p>
               <p>Neither is here any mention made expressly of preeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; for in this place the Scripture witnesseth, that the Sonne of man, that is, a man, was in Heaven, who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all controversy was not eternally preexistent. <hi>So they.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is expressly affirmed, that Christ <hi>was in Heaven,</hi> before his coming into the world. And if we evince his <hi>preexistence</hi> to his Incarnation, against the <hi>Socinians,</hi> the taske will not be diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to prove that preexistence to be in an <hi>eternall divine nature</hi> against the <hi>Arians.</hi> It is sufficient as to our intendment in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing this Testimony, that it is affirmed, that Christ <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> before his coming forth into the world; in what <hi>nature</hi> we elsewhere prove.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:115372:154"/>2. It is said indeed that the <hi>Sonne of man was in Heaven,</hi> which makes it evident, that he <hi>who is the Sonne of man,</hi> hath another nature, besides that wherein he is the Sonne of man, wherein he is the Sonne of God. And by affirming that the <hi>Sonne of man was in Heaven</hi> before, it doth no more assert that he was Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and in Heaven in that <hi>Nature,</hi> wherein he is the Sonne of man, then the Affirmation that <hi>God redeemed his Church with his own Blood,</hi> doth prove, that the blood shed was the <hi>blood of the divine nature.</hi> Both the Affirmations are concerning the Person of Christ. As he who was God, shed his blood as he was man; so he who was man, was <hi>Eternall,</hi> and in Heaven, as he was God. So that the Answer doth meerely <hi>begge</hi> the thing in question; <hi>viz. that Christ is not God and man in one person.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The insinuation here of Christs <hi>being in Heaven as man,</hi> before his assention, mentioned in the Scripture, shall be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, when we come to the proposall made of that figment by M. <hi>Biddle</hi> in his Chapter of the <hi>Propheticall office of Christ.</hi> In answer to the other Testimonyes recited, they thus proceed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the later end of their Chapter, concerning the Person of Christ.</p>

                  </note> What answerest thou to Joh. 3. 13. chap. 10. 36. chap. 16. 28. chap. 17. 18.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That a Divine nature is not here proved, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, because the words of the first Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, he came down from Heaven, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived figuratively, as <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 17. every good and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights: and <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 2, 10. I saw the holy City <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> coming down from God. But if the words be taken properly, which we willingly admit, it appeares, that they are not spoken of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Sonne of man, who seeing he hath necessarily an humane Person, he cannot by nature be God; Moreover, for what the Scripture witnesseth of Christ, that the Father sent him into the world, the same we read of the Apostles of Christ in the same words above alleadged: <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 18. as thou hast sent me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115372:154"/> the world, I have sent them into the world. And these words, Christ came forth from the Father, are of the same import with <hi>he descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Heaven.</hi> To come into the world is of that sort, as the Scripture manifests to have been after the Nativity of Christ. <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 37. where the Lord himselfe sayes: for this I am borne, and come into the world, that I might beare witnesse to the Truth: and 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 1. It is written, many false Prophets are gone forth into the world. Wherefore from this kind of speaking, a divine nature in Christ cannot be proved; but in all these speeches only what was the divine originall of the office of Christ, is described.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That these expressions are <hi>meerely figuratively</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, <note place="margin">§. 38.</note> they dare not assert; nor is there any colour given that they may be so received from the instances produced from <hi>James</hi> 1. 17. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. 2. for there is only mention made of <hi>descending, or comming down,</hi> which word we insist not on by it selfe, but as it is conjoyned with the Testimony of his <hi>being in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> before his <hi>descending;</hi> which takes off all pretence of a parity of Reason in the places compared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All that followes is a perfect <hi>begging</hi> of the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; because Christ is the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> it followes that he is a <hi>true man;</hi> but not, that he hath the <hi>personality</hi> of a man, or an <hi>humane personality.</hi> Personality belongs not to the <hi>Essence,</hi> but the <hi>Existence</hi> of a man. So that here they do but repeat their own <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> in answer to an expresse Testimony of Scripture against it. Their confession of the proper use of the word, is but to give colour to the figment formerly intimated, which shall be in due place (God assisting) discovered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They utterly omit, and take no notice of that place, where Christ sayes, <hi>he so came from Heaven,</hi> as that he was <hi>still in Heaven;</hi> nor do they mention any thing of that, which we lay
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:115372:155"/> greatest weight on, of his affirming that he <hi>was</hi> in Heaven <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;</hi> but merely insist on the word <hi>descending, or comming down,</hi> and yet they can no other way deale with that neither, but by <hi>begging</hi> the thing in question.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We do not argue meerely from the words of Christs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>sent into the world,</hi> but in this conjunct consideration, that he was so sent into the world, as that he <hi>was in Heaven before,</hi> and so came forth from the Father, and was with him in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven before his comming forth, and this our <hi>Catechists</hi> thought good to oversee.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The difference of Christs being sent into the world, and the Apostles by him, which they <hi>paralell,</hi> as to the purpose in hand, lyes in this, that Christ was so <hi>sent</hi> of the Father, that he came <hi>forth from the Father,</hi> and was <hi>with him in Heaven</hi> before his sending, which proves him to have another nature, then that wherein he was sent: the similitude alleadged consists quite in other things. Neither</p>
               <p n="6">6. Doth the Scripture in <hi>Joh.</hi> 18. 37. testify, that <hi>Christs sending into the world</hi> was after his Nativity, but only that the end of them both, was to beare witnesse to the truth; <hi>And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I was borne, and came into the world,</hi> are but the same, the one being exegeticall of the other. But his being <hi>borne,</hi> &amp; his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, is in the Testimonies cited, plainely asserted in reference to an <hi>Existence</hi> that he had in Heaven before. And thus as our Argument is not at all touched in this Answer, so is their Answer closed as it began, with the <hi>begging</hi> of that which is not only questioned, but sufficiently disproved, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Christ was in his humane nature <hi>taken up into Heaven,</hi> and instructed in the will of God, before his entrance upon his Propheticall office.</p>
               <p>And this is the whole of what they have to except against this evident Testimony of the divine nature of Christ. He was in Heaven, with the Father, before he came forth from the Father, or was sent into the world; and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>was in Heaven,</hi> when he <hi>was in the Earth,</hi> and at his Assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion returned thither where he was before. And so much for the vindication of this second Testimony.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. 62. is the second place I can meet with in all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notations of <hi>Grotius,</hi> wherein he seemes to assert the union of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:115372:155"/> the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ with the <hi>eternall word:</hi> if he do so. It is not with the Man that I have any difference, nor do I impose any thing on him for his Judgement; I only take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, having so great cause given, to discusse his <hi>Annotations.</hi>

                  <q>In this place the preeternity of Christ is not only not expressed, being it is one thing to be before <hi>Abraham,</hi> and another to be eternall, but also it is not so much as expressed, that he was before the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> For these words may otherwise be read; namely, verily, verily I say unto you, before <hi>Abraham</hi> was made I am; as it appears from those places in the same Evangelist, where the like Greek phrase is u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, Chap. 13. 19. &amp; 14. 29.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>What then would be the sence of this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding? Very eminent. For Christ admonisheth the Jewes, who would have ensnared him in his speech, that whilest they had time, they should believe in him the light of the World, before the divine grace which Christ offered to them, should be taken from them, and be carried to the Gentiles. But that these words, <hi>I am,</hi> are to be supplied in that manner, as if himselfe had added to them, <hi>I am</hi> the light of the World, appears, because that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his speech, v: 12. he had twice in those words, <hi>I am,</hi> called himselfe the light of the World. v: 24, 25. and that these words, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Abraham be,</hi> do signify that which we have said, may be perceived from the notati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that word <hi>Abraham;</hi> for it is evident, that <hi>Abraham</hi> notes the Father of many Nations: seeing then, that <hi>Abram</hi> was not made <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> before the grace of God, manifested in Christ, redounded to many Nations, for <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

               <p>If our Adversaries can well quit themselves of this <hi>Evidence,</hi> I believe they will have no small hopes of escaping in the whole triall. And if they meet with Judges so partially addicted to them, and their cause, as to accept of such manifest jugling, and perverting of the Scriptures, I know not what they may not expect or hope for. Especially, seeing how they exult, and triumph in this invention; as may be seen in the words of <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> himselfe, in his Answer to <hi>Erasmus Johannes</hi> p. 67.

I hoped rather that thou wouldest confesse; that in thy whole life thou had'st never heard an interpretation more acute, and true, then this, nor which did savour more of somewhat divine, or evidenced more clearly its revelation from God. I truly have not light conjectures, that he who brought it first to light in our age (now this was he, who in this age renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the opinion of the Originall of Christ, which I constantly defend) (<hi>that is, his Ʋncle Laelius</hi>) obtained it of Christ by many Prayers.

               <p n="1">1. Let the Christian Reader, without the least <hi>prejudiciall</hi> thoughts from the Interpretation of this, or that man, consult the Text, and Context. The Head of the discourse, which gives occasion to these words of Christ, concerning himselfe, lyes e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently and undeniably in v. 51. <hi>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death:</hi> upon this, the Jewes rise up against him, as one that boasted of himselfe above mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and preferred himselfe before his betters: v. 52. <hi>Then said the Iewes unto him, now we know that thou hast a Divell; Abraham is dead, and the Prophets, and thou sayest, if a man keep my sayings he shall never tast of death.</hi> and v. 53. <hi>Art thou greater then our Father Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, who is dead, and the Prophets are dead, whom makest thou thy selfe to be.</hi> Two things are here charged on him by the Jewes. First in <hi>generall,</hi> that he preferred, exalted, and honoured himselfe. 2. In <hi>particular,</hi> that he made himselfe better then <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father. To both which charges Christ answers in order in the following words: To the First, or generall charge of <hi>honouring himselfe.</hi> v. 54, 55. <hi>Iesus answered, if I honour my selfe, my honour is nothing; it is my Father that honoureth me, of whom ye say, that he is your God. Ye have not known him, but I know him, and if I should say I know him not, I shall be a Lyar like unto you; but I know him, and keep his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> His honour he had from God, whom they professed, but knew not. 2. To that of <hi>Abraham</hi> he replies, v. 56. <hi>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to see my day; and he saw it, and was glad.</hi> Though <hi>Abraham</hi> was so truly great, &amp; the <hi>Friend of God,</hi> yet his great joy was from his beliefe in me; whereby he saw my day. To this the Jewes reply, labouring to convince him of falsehood, from the impossibility of the things that he had asserted, v. 57. <hi>Thou art not yet fifty years old, and hast thou seen Abraham? Abraham</hi> was dead so many hundred years before thou wast borne; how couldest thou see him, or he thee? To this in the last place our Saviour replyes, v. 58. <hi>verily, verily, I say unto you, before Abraham was, I am.</hi> The Jews knowing that by these words he asserted his Deity,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:115372:157"/> and that it was impossible on any other account to make good that he who in their esteem was not <hi>fifty years old,</hi> (indeed but a little above thirty) should be before <hi>Abraham,</hi> as in a <hi>case of blasphemy,</hi> they take up stones to stone him, v: 59. as was their perpetuall manner, to attempt to kill him under pretence of blasphemy, when he asserted his Deity, as <hi>Joh. 5. 18. Therefore thought the Jewes the more to kill him,—because he said, that God was his Father, making himselfe equall with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This naked, and unprejudicate view of the Text, is sufficient <note place="margin">§. 41.</note> to obviate all the operous and sophisticall exceptions of our <hi>Catechists,</hi> so that I shall not need long to insist upon them. That which we have asserted may be thus proposed. He who in respect of his humane nature, was <hi>many hundred years</hi> after <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> yet was in another respect existing <hi>before him;</hi> He had an existence before his birth, as to his divine nature. Now this doth Christ expressely affirme concerning himselfe. And no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else is pretended but only his <hi>divine nature,</hi> wherein he should so exist. They say then,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That these words do not signify preeternity, but only something be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 42.</note>
                  <hi>Abraham.</hi> It is enough, that his Existence so many <hi>hundred years</hi> before his nativity is evidently asserted; his Eternity from thence will evidently be concluded, and they will not deny, that he may as well be <hi>eternall,</hi> as be before <hi>Abraham.</hi> But</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The words may be rendred, prinsquam Abraham fiat, ego sum;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham be made.</hi> But 1. They <hi>may</hi> be so rendred, is no proof at all that they ought to be so: and, as was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, if this be sufficient to evade the sence of a place, that any word in it <hi>may</hi> otherwise be rendred, because it is, or <hi>may</hi> be so in some other place, nothing certain can be concluded from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Testimony of the Scriptures whatever. But that they may not be so rendred, is evident. 1. From the <hi>Context,</hi> as before declared. 2. From the opposition between <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>I am,</hi> and <hi>Abraham was,</hi> which evidently denotes a time past, as it stands in comparison with what Christ saies of himselfe. And 3. The words in such a construction as this, requires an Interpretation as to the time past. And 4. because this Interpretation of the words corrupts the whole sence of the place, and wrests it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the designe, and intendment of our Saviour. But then they say,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:115372:157"/>3. <hi>The sence is excellent: for before Abraham be made, is as much as</hi>

                  <hi>before he be Abraham, or the Father of many Nations, which he was when the Gospell was Preached to the conversion of the Gentiles. I am, that is, I am the light of the world, which you should do well to walke in, and attend unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That this Interpretation in <hi>generall</hi> is altogether <hi>alien,</hi> and strange from the scope of the place, the Christian Reader, upon the bare view of it, will be able to judge. 2. It is <hi>false.</hi> 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Father of many Nations, <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selites,</hi> before the Preaching of the Gospell, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 5. 2. It is <hi>false,</hi> that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not <hi>Abraham,</hi> untill after the assension of Christ, and Preaching of the Gospell to the Gentiles.

It is <hi>frivolous;</hi> for if Christ was, before <hi>Abram</hi> was made <hi>Abraham,</hi> we obtain what we plead for, for he was made so, when God gave him that name. But, it should be, before <hi>Abram be made Abraham,</hi> or there is no sence in the words: nor then neither, unlesse <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> be taken as a common <hi>Appellative</hi> for the <hi>Father of many Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and not a Proper name, whereof in Scripture there is not any example. 4. It is <hi>horribly</hi> wrested, 1. In making the words, <hi>I am, Elipticall;</hi> whereas there is neither need of, nor colour for such a pretence. 2. In supplying the feigned <hi>Eclipsis</hi> with a word at such a distance, as from v. 12. to v. 58. 3. In making Christ to say, he is the <hi>Light of the world,</hi> before the Preaching of the Gospell to the Gentiles, when <hi>the World</hi> is every where in the Gospell taken quite in another sence, for the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and not for the <hi>Jewes</hi> only, which according to this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation it must be. 4. It leaves no reason of the following at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the <hi>Jewes</hi> to stone him, upon the particular provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Assertion, he having before affirmed himselfe to be the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> which they were not moved at.

                  </note> things to the Lord Iesus from Eternity?</p>
               <p>They are those, from which they endeavour to confirme that Christ was begotten from Eternity of the Essence of his Father.</p>
               <p>These are <hi>some</hi> of the places wherein this Property of the God-head, <hi>Eternity,</hi> is ascribed to our Saviour; it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed.</p>

                     <p>Ex his potissimum. <hi>Mich. 5. 2. Psal. 2. 7. &amp; 110. 10. Prov.</hi> 8. 23.</p>

               <p>These are only some of the Testimonies that are used to this purpose. 2.

               <p>
                  <q>Before I answer to each Testimony, it is to be known, that this Generation of the Essence of the Father is impossible. For if Christ were begotten of the Essence of his Father, either he tooke his whole Essence, or but part: part of his Essence he could not take, for the divine Essence is impartible: nor the whole, for it being one in number is incommunicable.</q>

               <p>And this is the fruit of measuring <hi>Spirituall</hi> things by <hi>carnall; infinite</hi> by <hi>finite;</hi> God by our selves; the object of <hi>Faith,</hi> by corrupted Rules of corrupted <hi>Reason.</hi> But 1. that which God hath <note n="*" place="margin">Nisi Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra dixisset, non licuisset dicere, sed ex qua scriptum est dici potest. <hi>Rabb.

                  <hi>revealed</hi> to be so, is not <hi>impossible</hi> to be so; <hi>let God be true &amp; all men lyers:</hi> that this is <hi>revealed,</hi> hath been undeniably evinced. 2. What is <hi>impossible</hi> in <hi>finite,</hi> limited Essences, may be possible &amp; convenient to that which is <hi>infinite</hi> &amp; <hi>unlimited;</hi> as is that whereof we speake. 3. It is not <hi>imposible,</hi> in the sence wherein that word must here be used, if any thing be signified by it. <hi>It is not, it cannot be so, in limited things,</hi> therefore not in things infinite; we cannot comprehend it, therefore it cannot be so; <hi>but the nature of the thing, about which it is, is inconssistent with it;</hi> this is denyed, for God hath revealed the contrary. 4. For the <hi>parting</hi> of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence, or receiving <hi>a part</hi> of the divine essence, our <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chists</hi> might have left out, as having none to push at with it, none standing in the way of that <hi>horne</hi> of their <hi>Dilemma.</hi> 5.

                  <q>Neither in that is there any thing of Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Essence of the Father, nor of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternall generation. For the word [to day] signifying a certaine time, cannot denote pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternity.

Because the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> brings these words to prove the Resurrection of Christ. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 33. And the Author to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> cites them for the glorifying of the Lord Jesus, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. and 5. 5.

               <p n="1">1.

               <p n="2">2. <hi>To day,</hi> being spoken of God, of him who is <hi>Eternall,</hi> to whom all time is so present, as that nothing is properly <hi>yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, nor to day,</hi> does not denote necessarily such a proportion of time, as is intimated.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It cannot be proved that the words are spoken at all of <hi>David,</hi> so much as <hi>Typically:</hi> nor any thing else in that <hi>Psalme</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 7. to the end. Yea the contrary is evident from every verse following; especially the 12. where <hi>Kings and Rulers</hi> are called to <hi>worship him,</hi> of whom he speakes, and threatned with <hi>destruction</hi> if they do not; and <hi>they</hi> are pronounced <hi>blessed</hi> who <hi>put their trust</hi> in him: which cannot be spoken of <hi>David;</hi> God declaring them to be cursed who put their trust in man: <hi>Jer.</hi> 17. 5, 6, 7.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is granted that the Apostle makes use of these words, when he mentions the <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Exaltation</hi> of Christ: not that Christ was then begotten, but that he was then <hi>declared</hi> to be the only begotten Sonne of God: his Resurrection and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation being <hi>manifestations</hi> of his Sonship, not causes of his <hi>Filiation,</hi> as hath been at large declared. So the <hi>Sun</hi> is said to <hi>arise</hi> when it doth first to us appeare.</p>
               <p n="5">5. True, <hi>God hath other Sons, and Believers are said to be begotten of God,</hi> but how? by <hi>Regeneration,</hi> &amp; turning from sin; as in the places quoted is evident. That Christ is so <hi>begotten</hi> of God, is blasphemous once to imagine. Besides, he is the <hi>only begotten</hi> Sonne of the Father, so that no other is begotten with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>same kind</hi> with him. It is evident then by this <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony,</hi> and from these words, that Christ is so the Son of God
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:115372:162"/> as no <hi>Angels</hi> are his Sonnes in the same kind: for that the Apostle produceth these words to prove, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>For unto which of the Angells said he at any time, thou art my Sonne, this day have I begotten thee;</hi> and againe, <hi>I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Sonne.</hi> Now the Angells are the Sonnes of God by <hi>Creation, Job.</hi> 1. 6. and 38. 7. He is also <hi>such a Son,</hi> and <hi>so</hi> begotten, as <hi>Believers</hi> are not. For they are <hi>begotten</hi> by <hi>Regeneration</hi> from sin, and <hi>Adoption</hi> into the <hi>Family</hi> of God: Therefore Christ who is the <hi>Sonne of God</hi> in another kind, then Angells and Men, who are so by Creation, Regeneration, and Adoption, is the <hi>naturall Sonne</hi> of God by <hi>Eternall Generation;</hi> which is also proved from this place.</p>

That this Argument is not firme appears from hence, that <hi>Solomon</hi> treats of Wisdome simply, and absolutely considered, without the addition of the Word, God; <hi>Paul</hi> not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and absolutely, but with the addition of the word, God. 2. <hi>Solomon</hi> treats of Wisdome, which neither is a Person, nor can be, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the diverse effects ascribed to this Wisdome, Chap. 7, 8, 9. amongst which are these words; By me Kings rule, and Princes decree Righteousnesse; and in the beginning of the Chapter, he brings in Wisdome sending her maidens, and inviting all to her: But <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="240" facs="tcp:115372:163"/> treateth of that Wisdome which is a Person, 3. The words which are rendred from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, in the Hebrew are <hi>à seculo;</hi> but that from everlasting, and <hi>à seculo,</hi> are diverse, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64. 4. <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 20. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 70. with many like places do declare.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Our Argument hence is: Christ the second Person of <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> the <hi>Trinity</hi> is spoken of, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22. under the name of <hi>Wisdome.</hi> Now it is said expresly there of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> that it was <hi>begotten from everlasting,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Eternall Generation</hi> of Christ is hence confirmed. Our Reasons are, 1. Because the things here spoken of can be applied to <hi>no other.</hi> 2. Because the very same things are affirmed of Christ, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 1. 3. Because Christ is the <hi>Wisdome of God,</hi> and so called in the Scripture; not only in the expression of <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. 2: That by <hi>Wisdome, Solomon</hi> intended the <hi>Wisdome of God,</hi> and that that word may be supplied, is most evident from what is spoken of it: Let the place be read, 3. Christ is called not only <hi>the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> but also <hi>Wisdome, absolutely</hi> and simply; and that not only <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 20. but <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 19. 4. The <hi>Wisdome</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> treats of, is evidently a <hi>Person,</hi> and such things are ascribed thereunto, as can be proper to none but a <hi>Person:</hi> such are those v: 30, 31. <hi>I was by him, one brought up with him, I was daily his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, rejoycing alwaies before him, rejoycing in the habitable part of the Earth, &amp;c.</hi> That it is the same <hi>Wisdome</hi> spoken of Chap: 7. and here, is not evident. Yet is there not any thing in that, attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it, but what suits well unto a <hi>Person.</hi> Much lesse in the beginning of the 9 Chapter, the <hi>Invitation</hi> there being such as may be made by a <hi>Person</hi> only: It is a <hi>Person</hi> who sends out <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers</hi> to invite to a banquet, as Christ doth in the Gospell. <hi>Kings rule, and Princes decree judgement</hi> by the Authority of a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and without him they can do nothing.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The word translated, <hi>from everlasting,</hi> is the same with that <note place="margin">§. 16.</note> considered before <hi>Mich:</hi> 5. 2. 2. The words following do so evidently confirme the meaning of the word to <hi>be as</hi> expressed, that it is marvelous the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> durst venture upon the excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this place. <hi>The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way,

               <p>And this is <hi>all,</hi> the whole summe of what any of our <hi>Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries,</hi> or rather the <hi>Adversaries of Jesus Christ,</hi> have to object in their cause against these Testimonies: whence we thus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue.</p>
               <p>He who was <hi>begotten</hi> of God the Father with an Eternall Generation, is Eternall; and so consequently God: but so is Jesus Christ begotten of God the Father, with an Eternall Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; Therefore he is Eternall, and God blessed for ever.</p>

                  <hi>Grotius</hi> takes no notice of Christ in this place, yea he seemes <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> evidently to exclude him from being here intended; his first note on v. 1. is, <hi>Haec de ea sapientia, quae in lege apparet, exponunt Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braei; &amp; sane ei, si non soli, at praecipuè haec attributa conveniunt. The Hebrews expound these things of that Wisdome which appears in the Law; and truly these Attributes agree thereunto, if not only, yet chiefly.</hi> Of this
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:115372:164"/> assertion he gives no reason. The contrary is evident from what is above said, and proved. The <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Moderne Rabbins</hi> in the exposition of those places of Scripture, which concerne the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is of no value.

Or to intimate, that the phrase here used is expounded by the use of it in those other places. If the first, he <hi>beggs</hi> that to be the sence of <hi>this</hi> place, which is the sence of <hi>them,</hi> though neither the scope of the places, nor the sence of the Words themselves, will beare it.

Let <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 30. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. be consulted, as paralell to this place. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4 speaks indeed of <hi>our predestination in</hi> Christ, <hi>that we should be holy,</hi> and so come to Glory: but of the Glory, that Christ <hi>had before the world was,</hi> it speakes not.

               <p>He who is <hi>Jehovah, God, the only true God,</hi> He is God properly by nature. But Jesus Christ is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the <hi>true God, &amp;c.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is God properly by nature.</p>
               <p>The proposition is cleare in it selfe; of the innumerable Testimonies which are, or may be produced to confirme the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption, our <hi>Catechists</hi> fix upon a very few, namely, those which are answered by <hi>Socinus</hi> against <hi>Weicke</hi> the <hi>Jesuite,</hi> whence most of their exceptions to these Witnesses are transcribed.

               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:115372:166"/>
               <p>The first Testimony is <hi>Jerem:</hi> 23. 6. in these words: <hi>In his dayes Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely, and this is his name whereby he shall be called, Jehovah our Righteousnesse.</hi> To which adde the next, <hi>Zech.</hi> 2. 8.</p>
               <p>Before I come to consider their <hi>Exceptions</hi> to these Texts in particular, some things in Generall may be premised, for the better understanding of what we are about; and what from these places we intend to prove and confirme.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The end of citing these two places, is to prove, that Jesus <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> Christ is in the Old Testament called <hi>Iehovah;</hi> which is by them denyed; the granting of it being <hi>destructive</hi> to their whole cause.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is granted, that <hi>Iehovah</hi> is the proper and peculiar name of the <hi>one</hi> only true God of Israel: a name as farre sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant of his Nature and Being, as possibly we are enabled to understand: yea so farre expressive of <hi>God,</hi> that as the thing signified by it, is <hi>incomprehensible,</hi> so many have thought the very word it selfe to be <hi>ineffable,</hi> or (at least) not <hi>lawfull</hi> to be utte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This name God peculiarly appropriates to himselfe, in an eminent manner, <hi>Exod:</hi> 6. 2, 9. So that this is taken for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on all hands, that he whose name is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> is the <hi>only true God,</hi> the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> when ever that name is used properly, without a <hi>Trope</hi> or figure, it is used of him only. What the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries of Christ except against this, shall be vindicated in its proper place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Our <hi>Catechists</hi> have very <hi>faintly</hi> brought forth the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that are usually insisted on in this cause; naming but <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> two of them; wherefore I shall take liberty to adde a few more to them, out of the many that are ready at hand. <hi>Isa.</hi> 40. 3. <hi>The voyce of him that cryeth in the Wildernesse, prepare ye the way of Iehovah, make straight in the desert an high way for our God.</hi> That it is Christ who is here called <hi>Iehovah,</hi> is cleare from that farther expressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 1. and the execution of the thing it selfe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 23. <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Mark.</hi> 1. 2, 3. <hi>Isa.</hi> 45. 22, 23, 24, 25. <hi>Look unto me, and be ye saved all the ends of the earth, for I am God, and there is none else, I have sworne by my selfe, the word is gone out of my mouth in Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and shall not returne, that unto mee every knee shall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ow, every tongue shall sweare: surely, shall one say, in the Lord Iehovah have I Righteousnesse and strength; even to him shall men come, and all that are
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115372:167"/> incensed against him, shall be ashamed; in Jehovah shall all the seed of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael be justified, and Glory.</hi> The Apostle expresly affirmes all this to be spoken of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11, 12, &amp;c. <hi>Hos.</hi> 13. 14. is also applied to Christ, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 54, 55. He that would at once con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider all the Texts of the Old Testament, chiefly ascribing this name to Christ, let him read <hi>Zanchius de tribus Elohim,</hi> who hath made a large collection of them.</p>
               <p>Let us now see what our Catechists except against the first <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> Testimony.</p>

At licet concedamus, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Jehovae ad Christum posse referri, ex altero tamen Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monio apparet asseri non posse, Iehovam simpliciter Christum vocari: ne{que} ex eo sequi, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum reipsâ esse Iehovam; sive igitur de Christo, sive de Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le postrema verba in Testimonia Hieremiae accipiantur, sententia ipsorum est, tum Iehovam unum Deum nostrum nos justificaturum. Etenim illo tempore, cum Christus appariturus esset, Deus id in Israele facturus erat.</p>
                     </note> that the name of Jehovah is attributed to Christ. For these words, And this is his name whereby they shall call him, the Lord our Righteousnesse, may be referred to Israel, of whom he spake a little before; In his daies shall Judah be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely, &amp;c. as from a like place may be seen in the same Prophet, Chap. 33. 15, 16. where he saith, In those daies, and at that time, will I cause the Branch of Righteousnesse to grow up unto David, and he shall execute judgement and Righteousnesse in the Land: In those daies shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely; and this is the name wherewith she shall be called, the Lord our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; for in the Hebrew it is expresly read, they shall call her; which last words are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred of necessity to Jerusalem; and in this place answereth to Israel, which is put in the first place: It seemes therefore likely, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the first place, these words. They shall call him, are referred to Israel. But although we should grant, that the name of Jehovah may be referred unto Christ, yet from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Testimonies it appears, that it cannot be asserted, that Christ is called Jehovah simply: neither doth it thence follow, that Christ is really Jehovah. Whether therefore these last
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:115372:167"/> words in this Testimony of Jeremiah be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of Christ, or of Israel, their sence is, thou Jehovah our one God wilt justify us; for at that time when Christ was to appeare, God would doe that in Israel.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The summe of this Answer is; 1. <hi>It may be</hi> these words are not spoken of Christ, but of <hi>Israel.</hi> 2. The same words are used of that which <hi>is not God.</hi> 3. If they be referred to <hi>Christ,</hi> they prove him not to be God. 4. Their sence is, that <hi>God will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify us in the daies of Christ.</hi> Of each briefly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Subject</hi> spoken of all along is <hi>Christ;</hi> He is the <hi>subject</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 7.</note>
                  <hi>matter</hi> of what ever here is affirmed. I will raise up a <hi>Righteous branch to David, He shall be a King,</hi> and he shall <hi>raigne,</hi> and his name shall be called <hi>the Lord our Righteousnesse.</hi> 2. Why are these words to be referred to <hi>Israel</hi> only, and not also to <hi>Judah,</hi> (if to any but Christ) they being both named together, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the same account, (yea and <hi>Judah</hi> hath the preheminence, being named in the first place) and if they belong to both, the words should be, <hi>this is their name, whereby they shall be called.</hi> 3. <hi>Israel</hi> was never called <hi>our Righteousnesse,</hi> but Christ is called so upon the matter in the New Testament sundry times, and <hi>is</hi> so; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 30. so that without departing from the propriety of the Words, intendment, and scope of the place, with the truth of the thing it selfe, these words cannot be so perverted. The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence used to them is notoriously manifest.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The expression is not the <hi>same</hi> in both places. Neither is <note place="margin">§. 8.</note>
                  <hi>Jerusalem</hi> there called the <hi>Lord our Righteousnesse;</hi> but He who calls her, is, the <hi>Lord our Righteousnesse;</hi> and so are the words ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> and others. And if what <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall be called be intimated, and not what <hi>His Name</hi> is that calls her, it is meerly by a <hi>Metonymy,</hi> upon the account of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Christ in her; As the Church is called <hi>Christ</hi> improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 12. <hi>Christ properly</hi> is Jesus only. But the words are not to be rendred, <hi>this is the name whereby she shall be called,</hi> but this is the <hi>name whereby he shall call her,</hi> the Lord our Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; that is, <hi>he who is the Lord our Righteousnesse</hi> shall <hi>call</hi> her to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115372:168"/> peace and safety, which are there treated on. Christ is our <hi>Righteousnesse, Jerusalem</hi> is not.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is evident that Christ is absolutely called <hi>Jehovah</hi> in <note place="margin">§. 9.</note>
                  <hi>this,</hi> as well as in the other places before mentioned, and many more. And it thence evidently followes, that he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as he who properly is called so, and understood by that name. Where God <hi>simply</hi> saies, his name is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> we believe him: and where he saies, the name of the <hi>Branch of the house of David</hi> is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> we believe him also. And we say hence, that <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Iehovah,</hi> or the words have not a tolerable sence: of this againe afterwards.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The interpretation given of the words is most <hi>perverse,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> and opposite to the meaning of them. The Prophet saies not, that <hi>Iehovah the one God shall be our Righteousnesse,</hi> but the <hi>Branch of David</hi> shall be <hi>the Lord our Righteousnesse.</hi> The subject is the <hi>Branch of David,</hi> not <hi>Jehovah.</hi> The <hi>Branch of David</hi> shall be called <hi>the Lord our Righteousnesse;</hi> that is, the <hi>Lord shall justify</hi> us, when the <hi>Branch of David</hi> shall be brought forth: Who could have disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this sence, but our <hi>Catechists</hi> and their <hi>Masters,</hi> whose words these are. It remaineth then, that the <hi>Branch of David, who Ruleth in Righteousnesse,</hi> is <hi>Jehovah</hi> our Righteousnesse: our <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> as being <hi>made</hi> so to us; <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as <hi>being</hi> so in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>

                  <q>These words, <hi>this is the True God,</hi> I deny to be referred to the Sonne of God. Not that I deny Christ to be true God: but that that place will not admit those words to be understood of Christ: for here he treats not only of the the true God, but of the only true God, as the article added in the Greeke doth declare. But Christ, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be true God, he is not yet of himselfe that one God, who by himselfe, and upon the most excellent account is God, seeing that is only God the Father. Nor doth it availe the Adversaries, who would have those words re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Christ, because the mention of Christ doth immediately goe before those words, this is the true God. For pronounce relatives as this and the like, are not alwayes referred to the next Antecedents, but often to that which is chiefely spoken of, as <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 19, 20. <hi>John</hi> 2. 7.
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115372:170"/> from which places it appeares, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noune relative, this, is referred not to the next, but to the most remote person.</q>

               <p n="2">2.

                  <hi>relate</hi> to the more remote Antecedent, but that in this place, that mentioned ought to do so, they pretend not once to urge: yea their Reason they give is against themselves; namely, that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to him chiefely spoken of, which here is eminently, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disputably <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> In the places by them produced, it is impossible from the subject matter in hand, that the <hi>Relative</hi> should be referred to any but the remoter Antecedent; but that therefore here we must offer violence to the words, and straine them into an <hi>Incoherence,</hi> and transgresse all rules of constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (nothing enforcing to such a proceedure) is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>

               <p>And this is all our Adversaries have to say against this most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse <note place="margin">§. 26.</note> Testimony of the Divine nature of Jesus Christ; in their entrance whereunto they cry <hi>haile Master,</hi> as one before them did, (<hi>he is a true God,</hi>) but in the close <hi>betray</hi> him (as farre as lyes in them) by denying his divine nature.</p>

And they are upon the same <hi>pin</hi> still, in their last expression, that these words are ascribed to the Father, v. 4. when they know that the Argument which they have undertaken to Answer, is, that the same <hi>names are ascribed to the Son,</hi> as to the Father, and therefore he is God equall with him. Their Answer is, this name is not ascribed to Christ, because it is ascribed to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Men must <hi>begge,</hi> when they can make no earnings at work. 5. We confesse Christ to be <hi>alius,</hi> another, another Person from
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115372:173"/> the Father; not another God, as our Catechists pretend.</p>
               <p>Having stopt the mouthes of our <hi>Catechists,</hi> we may briefly <note place="margin">§. 34.</note> consider the Text it selfe. That by this expression, <hi>who is, and who was, and who is to come,</hi> the Apostle expresses that name of God, <hi>Ehejeh, Exod.</hi> 3. 14. which as the Rabbins say, is of all <hi>sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> and expressive of all times, is evident. To which adde that other name of <hi>God, Almighty,</hi> and it cannot at all be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioned, but that <hi>He,</hi> who is intended in these words, is the <hi>only true God.</hi> 2. That the words are here used of Jesus Christ, is so undeniable from the Context, that <hi>his</hi> Adversaries thought good not once to mention it: v. 7. His coming is described in Glory: <hi>Behold He cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him, and all kindreds of the Earth shall waile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of him:</hi> whereupon himselfe immediately addes the words of this Testimony, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega:</hi> for 1. They are words spoken to <hi>John</hi> by him who gave him the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which was Iesus Christ: v. 1. 2. They are the words of him that speaks <hi>on</hi> to <hi>John,</hi> which was Iesus Christ, v. 18. 3. Iesus Christ twice in this Chapter afterwards gives himselfe the same title, v. 11. <hi>I am Alpha and Omega;</hi> and v. 17. <hi>I am the first and the last;</hi> But who was He? <hi>I am he that liveth, and was dead; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I live for evermore, Amen: and have the keys of Hell and death,</hi> v. 18. He gave the Revelation; He is described; He speaks all all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies; He gives himselfe the same Titles <hi>twice</hi> againe in this Chapter.</p>
               <p>But our <hi>Catechists</hi> think they have taken a course to prevent all this, and therefore have avoided the consideration of the <note place="margin">§. 35.</note>
                  <hi>words,</hi> as they are placed, Chap. 1. v. 8. considering the <hi>same words</hi> in Chap. 4. 8. where they want some of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, which in this place give light to their Application. They are not there spoken by any that ascribes them to himselfe, but by others are ascribed <hi>to him that sits on the Throne,</hi> who cry (as the <hi>Seraphims Isa. 6. 3) Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which is, which was, and which is to come.</hi> But yet there wants not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to evince, that these words belong immediately in this place also to Iesus Christ. For 1. They are the name (as we have seen) whereby not long before he reveals himselfe. 2. They are spoken of him, who <hi>sits on the Throne,</hi> in the midst of the Christian Churches here represented. And if Christ be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:115372:174"/> in these words, there is no mention of his <hi>presence</hi> in his Church, in that solemne Representation of its Assembly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he promised to be in the <hi>middest</hi> of his, <hi>to the end of the World.</hi> 3. The honour that is here ascribed to him that is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, is because he is <gap reason="foreign">

Our <hi>Catechists</hi> know not what to say; <hi>necessarily</hi> this word God is not to be referred to Christ; it <hi>may</hi> be referred to God the Father. Give an instance of the like phrase of speech, and take the interpretation. Can it be said that <hi>ones</hi> blood was shed, when it was <hi>not shed,</hi> but anothers, and no mention that that others blood was shed? 3. If the Fathers blood was shed, or said truly to be shed, because Christs blood was shed; Then you may say, that <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Father dyed,</hi> and was <hi>crucifyed</hi> under <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and God the Father rose <hi>from the dead,</hi> that he <hi>was dead,</hi> and is <hi>alive:</hi> That that blood that was shed, was not Christs, but some bodyes else, that he loved &amp; was neere unto him. 4. There is no <hi>Analogy</hi> between that of the Prophet, of the <hi>Apple of Gods eye,</hi> and this here spoken of. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controlably a <hi>Metaphor</hi> must there be allowed; here is no <hi>meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor</hi> insisted on; but that which is the blood of Christ, is called the blood of God, and Christ <hi>not</hi> to be that God is their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:115372:175"/> There diverse persons are spoken of, God and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: here one only, that did that which is expressed. And all the force of this exposition lyes in this, <hi>there is a figurative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression in one place, the matter spoken of requiring it, therefore here must be a figure admitted also, where there is not the same reason:</hi> what is this but to make the Scripture a <hi>nose of wax?</hi> This worke of <hi>redeeming the Church with his blood,</hi> is ever ascribed to <hi>Christ,</hi> as peculiar to him, constantly without exception; and never to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: neither would our Adversaries allow it to be so here, but that they know not how to stand before the Testimony wherewith they are pressed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If because of the <hi>conjunction</hi> that is between God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">§. 40.</note> and Christ, the Blood of Christ may be called the <hi>blood of God</hi> the Father; then the <hi>hunger and thirst of Christ, his dying and being buried, his rising againe,</hi> may be called the hunger and thirst of God the Father, his sweating, dying, and rising. And he is a strange naturall and proper Sonne, who hath a quite different nature and essence from his own proper Father, as is here affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Christ is called the <hi>Lamb</hi> of God, as answering and full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling all the Sacrifices, that were made to God of old: and if the blood of Christ may be called the blood of God the Father, because he appointed it to be shed for us: then the blood of any Sacrifice was also the blood of a man, that appointed it to be shed, yea of God, who ordained it. The words are, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>What there is either in their <hi>Exceptions,</hi> or <hi>Exposition,</hi> of weight to take of this evident Testimony, shall briefely be considered.</p>
               <p>The first exception of the <hi>kind of causality,</hi> which is here as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to Christ, hath already been considered and removed, <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> by manifesting the very <hi>same</hi> kind of Expression, about the <hi>same</hi> things, to be used concerning God the Father. 2. Though the word, <hi>Creation,</hi> be used concerning the <hi>New Creation,</hi> yet it is in places where it is evidently and distinctly spoken of, in opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the former state, wherein they were, who were <hi>so</hi> crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But here, as was above demonstrated, the <hi>old creation</hi> is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, in direct distinction from the <hi>new,</hi> which the Apostle describes, and expresses in other termes (<hi>v.</hi> 20.) If that may be called the <hi>New Creation,</hi> which layes a foundation of it, as the death of Christ doth of Regeneration. And unlesse it be in <hi>that cause,</hi> the worke of the <hi>New Creation</hi> is not spoken of at all in this place. 3. Where Christ is said <hi>to reconcile all things to himselfe that are in Heaven and earth,</hi> he speakes plainely, and evidently of another worke, distinct from that which he had, described in these verses; and where as <hi>Reconciliation</hi> supposes a past <hi>Enmity,</hi> the <hi>All things</hi> mentioned in the 20. verse, can be none, but those which were sometime at <hi>Enmity</hi> with God. Now none but men, that ever had any <hi>enmity</hi> against God, or were at <hi>enmity</hi> with him, were ever reconciled to God, It is then <hi>men in Heaven</hi>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:115372:178"/> and Earth, to whose reconciliation in their severall Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the efficacy of the blood of Christ did extend, that is there Intended. 4. Not <hi>Heaven and Earth</hi> are named, but <hi>all things</hi> in them, as being most immediately expressive of the Apostles purpose, who naming <hi>all things</hi> in generall, chose to instance in <hi>Angells</hi> and <hi>men:</hi> as also insisting on the expression, which is used concerning the Creation of all things in sundry places, as hath been shewed; though he mentions not all the words in them used.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Exposition</hi> they give of these words, it is most <hi>ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> For 1. The Apostle doth not speake of Christ, as he is <hi>exalted</hi> after his Resurrection, but describes him in his <hi>divine</hi> nature and being. 2. To <hi>translate</hi> out of one condition into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, is not to <hi>create</hi> the thing so translated, though another <hi>new thing</hi> it may. When a man is made a <hi>magistrate,</hi> we doe not say he is <hi>made a man,</hi> but he is made a <hi>Magistrate.</hi> 3. The new Creation which they here affirme to be spoken of, is by no meanes to be accommodated unto <hi>Angells;</hi> In both the places mentioned by themselves, and in all places where it is spoken of, it is expressive of a change from <hi>bad</hi> to <hi>good,</hi> from <hi>evill</hi> actions, to <hi>Grace,</hi> and is the same with <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> which cannot be ascribed to <hi>Angells,</hi> who never sinned, nor <note place="margin">

The <hi>Dominion of Christ over Angells and men</hi> is no where called a <hi>new creation;</hi> nor is there any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour or pretence why it should be so expressed. 5. The <hi>New Creation</hi> is in Jesus Christ, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. but to be in Christ, is to be implanted into him by the Holy Spirit by believing, which by no meanes can be <hi>accommodated</hi> to Angells. 6.

Now that that Authour doth not referre the first unto Christ, is hence evident, because in that Chapter He proposeth to himselfe to demonstrate the excellency of Christ above the Angells, not that which he hath of himselfe, but that which he had by Inheritance, and whereby he is made better then the Angells, as is plaine to any one <hi>v.</hi> 4. of which kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence seeing that the Creation of Heaven and Earth is not, nor can be, it appeareth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly, that this Testimony is not urged by this writer to prove that Christ Created Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth. Seeing therefore the first part cannot be referred to Christ, it appeareth, that the latter only is to be referred to him: and that because by him God will abolish Heaven and Earth, when by him he shall execute the Last Judgement: whereby the excellency of Christ above Angells shall be so conspicuous, that the Angells themselves shall in that very thing serve him. And seeing this last speech could not be understood without those former words, wherein mention is made of Heaven and Earth, being joyned to them by this word <hi>they,</hi> therefore the Author had a necessity to make mention of them also.

               <p n="3">3. It is <hi>shamelesse impudence</hi> in these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> to take upon <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> them to say, that <hi>this</hi> part of the Apostles Testimony, which he produceth, is to his purpose, <hi>that</hi> not; as if they were wiser then the Holy Ghost, and knew <hi>Pauls</hi> designe better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>

                  <hi>viz.</hi> that all the proofes of the excellency of Christ, above Angells, insisted on by the Apostle, belong peculiarly to what he is said to <hi>receive by Inheritance.</hi> The designe of the Apostle is, to prove the Excellency of Christ, in himselfe, and then in comparison of <hi>Angels;</hi> and therefore before the mention of what he received by Inheritance, he affirmes directly, that by him <hi>God made the worlds.</hi> And to this end it is most evident, that this Testimony, that he Created <hi>Heaven and Earth,</hi> is most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly subservient.</p>
               <p n="5">5.

               <p n="7">7. There is not then the least colour, or pretence, of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> this <hi>first part</hi> of the Testimony to belong to Christ. The whole is spoken of, to the <hi>same purpose,</hi> to the <hi>same person,</hi> belongs to the <hi>same matter</hi> in generall; and that first expression is, if not only, yet mainely, and chiefely effectuall to confirme the intendment of the Apostle; proving directly, that Christ is <hi>better,</hi> and more <hi>excellent</hi> then the <hi>Angels,</hi> in that he is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that made Heaven and Earth; they are but his Creatures: As God often compares himselfe with others. In the <hi>Psalmist</hi> the words respect chiefely the making of Heaven and Earth, and these
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115372:184"/> words are applyed to our Saviour. That the two workes of <hi>making</hi> and <hi>abolishing</hi> the world, should be assigned distinctly unto two Persons, there is no pretence to affirme. This bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse indeed is intollerable.</p>
               <p n="8">8. To <hi>abolish</hi> the world is no lesse a worke of Almighty Power, then to <hi>make</hi> it: nor can it be done by any but him <note place="margin">§. 30.</note> that <hi>made</hi> it; and this confessedly is ascribed to Christ. And both alike belong to the asserting of the excellency of God above all creatures, which is here aymed to be done.</p>
               <p n="9">9. The Reason given why the first words, which are nothing to the purpose, are cited with the latter, is a miserable <hi>begging</hi> of the <note place="margin">§. 31.</note> thing in question; Yea the first words are chiefely and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently to the Apostles <hi>purpose,</hi> as hath been shewed. We dare not say <hi>only,</hi> for the Holy Ghost knew better then we, what was to his purpose, though our <hi>Catechists</hi> be wiser in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits then He. Neither is there any Reason imaginable, why the Apostle should rehearse more words here out of the Psalme, then were directly to the businesse he had in hand; seeing how many Testimonies he cites, and some of them very briefely, leaving them to be supplyed from the places whence they are taken.</p>
               <p n="10">10. That others of the holy Writers doe urge Testimonies <note place="margin">§. 32.</note>
                  <hi>not to their purpose, or beyond what they need,</hi> is <hi>false</hi> in it selfe, and a bold imputation of weaknesse to the Penmen of the Holy Ghost. The instances hereof given by our Adversaries, are not at all to to the purpose, which they are persuing. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. In no one of them is there a <hi>Testimony</hi> cited, whereof one part should concerne <hi>one Person,</hi> and another <hi>another,</hi> as is here pretended: and without farther processe this is sufficient to evince this evasion of impertinency: for nothing will amount to the interpretation they enforce on this place, but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing of some place of the <hi>New</hi> Testament, where a Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is cited out of the <hi>Old,</hi> speaking throughout of the same Person, whereof the <hi>one</hi> part belongs to <hi>him,</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> not: although that, which they say <hi>doth not belong to him,</hi> be most <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> for the confirmation of what is affirmed of him, and what the whole is brought in proofe of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is not any of the places instanced in by them, wherein the <hi>whole</hi> of the words is not directly to the purpose
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115372:184"/> in hand, although some of them are more immediately suited to the occasion on which the whole Testimony is produced; as it were easy to manifest by the consideration of the severall places.</p>
               <p n="3">3. These words, <hi>thou hast loved Righteousnesse, and hated Iniquity,</hi> are not mentioned to prove immediately the Excellency of <hi>Christ</hi> above <hi>Angels,</hi> but his administration of his Kingdome, on which account he is so Excellent, among others; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto they are most proper.</p>
               <p>And this is the issue of their Attempt against this Testimony, <note place="margin">§. 33.</note> which being thus briefely <hi>vindicated,</hi> is sufficient alone of it selfe to <hi>consume with its brightnes</hi> al the oposition, which from the <hi>darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> of Hell or Men, is made against the Deity of Christ.</p>
               <p>And yet we have <hi>one</hi> more to consider, before this text be dismissed. <hi>Grotius</hi> is nibling at this Testimony also. His <note place="margin">§. 34.</note> words are: <hi>Againe, that which is spoken of God he applyes to the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah:</hi>

               <p>This is not the first time we have met with this conceite.

But <hi>jacta est alea.</hi> I say then, that the Apostle doth not <hi>apply</hi> that to <hi>one</hi> Person, which was spoken of <hi>another;</hi> but asserts the words in the <hi>Psalme</hi> to be spoken of him, concerning whom he treates; and thence proves his Excellency, which is the businesse he hath in hand. It is not to <hi>adorne</hi> Christ with <hi>Titles,</hi> which were not due <hi>to</hi> him, (which to doe were <hi>Robbery</hi>) but to prove by <hi>Testimonies</hi> that were given <hi>of</hi> him, that he is no lesse then he affirmed him to be, even God blessed for ever. 2. Let any man in his right wits consider this Interpretation, and try whether he can per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade himselfe to receive it: <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:115372:185"/> Lord were the foundations of the Earth laid: and the Heavens are the workes of thy hands,</hi> that is, <hi>they were made for thee.</hi> Any man may thus make <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet;</hi> but whether with due reverence to the word of God, I Question. 3. It is not about the sence of the <hi>Hebrew particles</hi> that we treat, (and yet the Learned man cannot give one cleare instance of what he affirmes) but of the designe of the Holy Ghost in the <hi>Psalme,</hi> and in this place of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> applying these words to Christ. 4. I marvell he saw not, that this interpretation doth most des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately <hi>cut</hi> its own throat, the parts of it being at an irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable difference among themselves. For in the first place he saies, the words are spoken of <hi>God,</hi> and applyed to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and then proves the sence of them to be such, as they cannot be spoken of <hi>God</hi> at all, but merely of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> for to that sence doth he labour to wrest both the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and <hi>Greeke</hi> Text. Me thinks the Words being spoken of <hi>God,</hi> and not of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but only fitted to him by the Apostle, there is no need to say that, <hi>thou hast laid the foundations of the Earth,</hi> is, that it was <hi>laid for thy sake: and the Heavens are the workes of thy hands,</hi> that is, they were <hi>made for thee:</hi> seeing they are properly spoken of God. This one <hi>Rabinicall</hi> figment, of the worlds being made for the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is the engine, whereby the <hi>Learned man</hi> turnes about, and perverts the sence of this whole Chapter. In briefe, if either the plaine sence of the words, or the intendment of the Holy Ghost in this place, be of any account, yea if the <hi>Apostle</hi> deales honestly, and sincerely, and speakes to what he doth propose, and urges that which is to his purpose, and doth not falsely apply that to Christ which was never spoken of him, this <hi>Learned Glosse</hi> is directly contrary to the <hi>Text.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The words in the foregoing verses, repeated by the Apostle,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:115372:187"/> manifest, that it is the <hi>vision</hi> mentioned <hi>Isa.</hi> 6. that the Apostle relates unto: whence we thus argue: <hi>He whose Glory Isaiah saw,</hi> Chap. 6. <hi>was the Holy, Holy, Holy Lord of Hosts</hi> v. 3. <hi>the King, the Lord of Hosts,</hi> v. 5. But this was <hi>Jesus Christ, whose Glory Isaiah</hi> then saw, as the Holy Ghost witnesses in these words of <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. 41. What say our Catechists.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>First it appeares that these words are not <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> necessarily referred to Christ, because they may <note place="margin">Primum, ea verba ad Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stum non necessario referri hinc apparet, quod de Deo Patre accipi possint: etemim verbae paulo superiora de eodem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur. Excaecavit, indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, sanavit. Deinde, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, quam Esaias vidit poterat esse, imo erat, non praesens, sed futura.

Et in gloria illius unius Dei vidit etiam Esaias Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam Christi Domini. Ait enim ibidem vates, plena est terra gloria Dei, <hi>Esa.</hi> 6. 3. Tum autem hoc reipsa factum est, cum Jesus Cristus illi populo primum apparuit, &amp; post toti mundo annunciatus est.</note> be understood of God the Father. For the words a little before are spoken of him, He hath blinded, hardned, healed. Then the Glory that Isaiah saw might be, nay was not present but future: for it is proper to Prophets to see things future, whence they are called Seers: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 9. Lastly although these words should be understood of that Glory which was then present and seen to Isaiah, yet to see the Glory of one and to see himselfe are farre different things. And in the Glory of that one God, Isaiah saw also the Glory of the Lord Christ. For the Prophet sayes there, the whole Earth is full of the Glory of God v. 3. But then was this accomplished in reallity, when Jesus appeared to that People, and was afterwards preached to the whole world.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is most evident, that these men know not <hi>what</hi> to say, nor <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> what to stick to, in their interpretation of this place. This makes them heap up so many severall suggestions, contradictory one to another, crying, that it <hi>may he thus,</hi> or it <hi>may be thus.</hi> But 1. That these words cannot be referred to God the Father, but must of necessity be referred to Christ, is evident, because there is no occasion of mentioning him in this place, but an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is given of what was spoken v. 37. <hi>but though he had done so many miracles before them yet they believed not on him:</hi> to which answers this verse, <hi>when he saw HIS Glory, and spake of HIM.</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words of <hi>blinding</hi> and <hi>hardning,</hi> are evidently alleadged, to give an account of the Reason of the Jewes obstinacy in their
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:115372:188"/> unbeliefe, not relating immediately to the person spoken of. The subject matter treated of, is Christ. The occasion of mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this Testimony, is Christ. Of him here are the words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. 2. The <hi>Glory Isaiah saw was present;</hi> all the <hi>circumstances</hi> of the vision evince no lesse. He tells you the <hi>time, place,</hi> and <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances</hi> of it, <hi>when</hi> he <hi>saw</hi> the <hi>Seraphims,</hi> when he heard their <hi>voice;</hi> when the <hi>doore</hi> moved at the voice of him that cryed, when the <hi>house</hi> was filled with Glory, and when he himselfe was so terrifyed, that he cryed out, <hi>wo is me, for I am undone.</hi> If any thing in the world be certaine, it is certaine, that he <hi>saw that Glory present.</hi> 3. He did not only <hi>see his Glory,</hi> but he <hi>saw him:</hi> or he so saw his Glory, as that he <hi>saw him,</hi> so as he may be seen; So the Prophet sayes expressly: <hi>I have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts:</hi> And what the Prophet sayes of seeing the Lord of Hosts, the Apostle expresses by seeing his Glory, because he saw him in that glorious vision, or saw that glorious representation of his presence. 4. He did indeed see the Glory of the Lord Christ, in <hi>seeing the Glory of the one God,</hi> He being the true God of <hi>Israel,</hi> and on no other account is his Glory seen, then by seeing the Glory of the one true God. 5. The Prophet doth not say, that the <hi>Earth was full of the glory of God,</hi> but it is the Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the <hi>Seraphims</hi> made one to another, concerning <hi>that</hi> God, whose presence was then there manifested. 6. When Christ first appeared to the People of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> there was no great manifestation of Glory. The Earth was alwaies full of the Glory of God. And if those words have any peculiar relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Glory of the Gospell, yet withall they prove, that He was then present, whose <hi>Glory in the Gospell</hi> was afterwards to fill the Earth.</p>

Even such let all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings appeare to be, that are against the Eternall Deity of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p>In his Annotations on the 6. of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> where the <hi>vision</hi> insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on is expressed, He takes no notice at all of Jesus Christ, or the second Person of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> Nor (which is very strange) doth he so much as once intimate, that what is here spoken, is applyed by the Holy Ghost unto Christ in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; Nor once names the Chapter where it is done.

                  <q>That Christ is equall to God, doth no way <note place="margin">Qui porro ad ea loca re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondes? Quod Christus sit aequalis deo, id divinam in co naturam nullo modo probat, imo hinc res adversa colligitur. Nam si Christus deo, qui natura deus est, aequalis est, efficitur, quod is idem deus esse non possit. Aequalitas vero christi cum Deo in eo est, quod ea virtute, quam in eum contulit deus, ea omnia efficeret, &amp; efficiat, quae ipsius der sunt, tanquam deus ipse.</note> prove, that there is in him a divine Nature.

               <p>This being the whole of what they tender, to extricate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <note place="margin">§. 8.</note> from the <hi>Chaines,</hi> which this witnes casts upon them, now lying before us, I shall propose our <hi>Argument</hi> from the words, and proceed to the vindication of it in order.</p>
               <p>The intendment and designe of the Apostle in this place, <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> being evidently to exhort Believers to <hi>selfedenyall, mutuall love,</hi> and <hi>condescention</hi> one to another, he proposes to them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Jesus Christ: and lets them know, that he being in the <hi>forme of God,</hi> and <hi>equall to God</hi> therein; (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>existing</hi> in that forme, having both the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of God,) did yet in his love to us, <hi>make himselfe of no reputation,</hi> or lay aside, and <hi>eclipse</hi> his Glory, in this, that he tooke upon him the <hi>forme of a servant,</hi> being <hi>made man,</hi> that in that forme, and nature, He might be obedient unto death, for us, and in our behalfe: Hence we thus plead.</p>
               <p>He that was in the <hi>forme of God, and equall to God, existing</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 10.</note>
                  <hi>therein, and tooke on him the nature, and forme of a servant, He is God by nature, and was Incarnate, or made flesh, in the sence before spoken of: Now all this is affirmed of Jesus Christ:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To this they say, (that we may consider that first, which <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> is first in the Text) that his being <hi>equall</hi> to God, doth not prove him to be <hi>God</hi> by nature: but the contrary, &amp;c. as above. But 1. if none is, nor can, by the Testimony of God himselfe, be <hi>like</hi> God, or <hi>equal</hi> to him, who is not God by nature; then he that is <hi>equall to him,</hi> is so: but, <hi>to whom will ye liken me, or shall I be equall, saith the Holy one, lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these things,</hi> Isa. 40. 25. none, that hath not created <hi>all things</hi> of no thing, can be equall to him: <hi>And to whom will ye liken me, and make me equall, and compare me, that we may be like,</hi> Chap. 46. 5. (2.) Between that which is <hi>finite</hi> and that which is <hi>infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,</hi> that which is <hi>eternall,</hi> and that which is <hi>temporall,</hi> the <hi>Creature</hi> and the <hi>Creatour, God by nature,</hi> and him, who by <hi>nature is not God,</hi> It is utterly impossible there should be any <hi>Equality.</hi> 3. God having so often avouched his <hi>infinite</hi> distance from all <hi>Creatures,</hi> his refusall to give his glory to any of them, his <hi>ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality</hi>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:115372:190"/> with them all, it must have been the highest <hi>Robbery,</hi> that ever any could be guilty of, for Christ to make himselfe <hi>equall to God,</hi> if he were not God. 4. The Apostles Argument arises from hence, that he was <hi>equall</hi> to God, before he tooke on him the forme of a <hi>Servant,</hi> which was before his working of those mighty workes, wherein these <hi>Gentlemen</hi> assert him to be <hi>equall</hi> to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Themselves cannot but know the ridiculousnesse of their <note place="margin">§. 12.</note>
                  <hi>begging</hi> the thing in question, when they would argue, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>He was equall to God,</hi> He was <hi>not</hi> God: He was the same <hi>God in nature, and Essence,</hi> and therein <hi>equall</hi> to him, to whom he was in subordination, as the <hi>Sonne;</hi> and in <hi>Office</hi> a <hi>Servant,</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the worke of Mediation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The case being as by them stated, there was no <hi>equality</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> between Christ and God, in the <hi>workes he wrought:</hi> For 1. God doth the workes in his own <hi>Name,</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> Christ in Gods. 2. God doth them by his <hi>own Power,</hi> Christ by Gods. 3. God doth them <hi>himselfe,</hi> Christ not, but God in him, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other from him. 4. He doth not do them <hi>as</hi> God, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that expression be taken; for according to these men, He wrought them, neither in his <hi>own name,</hi> nor by his <hi>own power,</hi> nor for his <hi>own glory,</hi> all which he must doe, who doth things, <hi>as</hi> God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is said to be <hi>equall to God,</hi> not as He did such, and such <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> workes, but as, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Equality</hi> with him; or else all the Prophets, and Apostles, that wrought <hi>miracles,</hi> were also equall to God. The <hi>infinite inequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of nature between the Creatour and the most Glorious Creature, will not allow, that it be said on any account to be equall to him. Nor is it said, that Christ was equall to God, in <hi>respect of the workes He</hi> did, but <hi>Absolutely, He thought it no Robbery to be equall to God.</hi> And so is their <hi>last</hi> plea to the <hi>first</hi> part of our <hi>Argument</hi> accounted for: come we to what they begin withall.</p>
               <p n="1">1. We contend not (as hath been often said) about <hi>words</hi>

               <p n="3">3. It is from his being <hi>equall</hi> with God, in the <hi>forme</hi> of God, <note place="margin">§. 17.</note> whereby we prove, that his being in the <hi>forme</hi> of God doth denote his divine Nature: but of this our <hi>Catechists</hi> had no minde to take notice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>forme of a servant,</hi> is that which he tooke, when he <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> was made <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; as <hi>Adam</hi> begat a Sonne in his own <hi>likenesse.</hi> Now this was not only in <hi>condition a servant,</hi> but in <hi>reallity, a man.</hi> 2. The <hi>forme of a servant</hi> was that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he underwent death, the death of the Crosse; but he dyed as a <hi>man,</hi> and not only in the appearance of a Servant. 3. The very phrase of <hi>expression</hi> manifests the humane nature of Christ to be denoted hereby: only as the Apostle had not before said directly that he <hi>was God,</hi> but in the <hi>forme of God,</hi> expressing both his nature, and his Glory, so here he doth not say <hi>He was a man, but in the forme of a Servant,</hi> expressing both his <hi>nature and his condition,</hi> wherein he was the servant of the Father. Of him it is said <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: He <hi>was</hi> in the <hi>other,</hi> but <hi>this</hi> He <hi>tooke.</hi> 4. To be a <hi>servant</hi> denotes the state or condition of a man: but for <hi>one</hi> who was in the <hi>forme of God and equall to him,</hi> to be made in the <hi>forme of a servant,</hi> and to be <hi>found as a man,</hi> and to be in that <hi>forme put to death,</hi> denotes in the first place, a taking of that <hi>nature,</hi> wherein alone he could be a servant. And this Answers also to other expressions, of the <hi>Word being made flesh,</hi> and God <hi>sending forth his own Sonne made of a woman.</hi> 5. This is manifest from the expression, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; He <hi>was found in fashion as a man:</hi> that is, He
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:115372:191"/> was truely so; which is <hi>exegeticall</hi> of what was spoken before <hi>He took on him the forme of a servant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But they say this is of no importance; <hi>For the same is said of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 19.</note>
                  <hi>Sampson,</hi> Judg. 16. 7, 11. <hi>and of others</hi> Psal. 82. <hi>who yet we doe not say were incarnate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These <hi>Gentlemen</hi> are still like themselves. Of Christ it is said, that he <hi>humbled</hi> himselfe, and tooke upon him the forme of a <hi>Servant,</hi> and was found in likenesse as a <hi>man:</hi> of <hi>Sampson,</hi> that being stronger then an <hi>hundred men,</hi> if he were dealt so and so withall, he would <hi>become as other men,</hi> for so the words expressly are: no stronger then another man; and these places are <hi>paralell:</hi> much good may these <hi>paralells</hi> doe your <hi>Catechumens.</hi> And so of those in the <hi>Psalme,</hi> that though in this world they are <hi>high in power</hi> for a season, yet they should dy as other <hi>men</hi> do. Hence, in a way of triumph and merriment, they aske, if these were <hi>incarnate,</hi> and answer themselves, that surely we will not say so. True, he who being as <hi>strong</hi> as many becomes by any meanes to be as <hi>one,</hi> and they who <hi>live</hi> in power, but <hi>dye</hi> in weakenesse, as other men doe, are not said to be incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate: but He who <hi>being God, tooke on him the forme of a Servant, and was in this world a very man,</hi> may (by our new Masters leave,) be said to be so.</p>
               <p>For the sence which they give us of this place, (for they are <hi>bold</hi> to venture at it) it hath been in part spoken to already. Christ <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> was in the world, as to outward appearance, no way <hi>instar Dei,</hi> but rather as he sayes of himselfe, <hi>instar vermis.</hi> That he did the <hi>workes of God,</hi> and was worshiped as God, was because <hi>He was God;</hi> nor could any but God, either doe the one, <hi>as</hi> He did them, or admit of the other. 2. This is the exposition given us; <hi>Christ was in the forme of God, counting it no robbery to be equall to him, that is, whilst he was here' in the world in the forme of a servant, He did the workes of God and was worshiped.</hi> 3. Christ was in the forme of a <hi>Servant</hi> from his first coming into the world, &amp; as <hi>one of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> Therefore He was not <hi>made</hi> so by any thing afterwards: his being <hi>bound, and beate, and killed,</hi> is not his being made a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; for that by the Apostle is afterwards expressed, when he tells us <hi>why,</hi> or for <hi>what end,</hi> not <hi>how,</hi> or <hi>wherein</hi> He was made a Servant; <hi>viz.</hi> He became obedient to death, the death of the Crosse.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:115372:192"/>
               <p>And this may suffice for the taking out of our way, all that <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> is excepted against this testimony by our <hi>Catechists:</hi> but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Text is of great importance, and of it selfe sufficient to evince the Sacred truth we plead for, some farther ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, for the illustration of it, may be added.</p>
               <p>The sence they intend to give us of these words is plainely <note place="margin">§. 22.</note> this: that <hi>Christ by doing miracles in the world, appeared to be as God, or as a God: but he laid aside this forme of God, and tooke upon him the forme of a servant, when He suffered himself to be taken, bound, &amp; crucifyed: He began to be,</hi> they say, <hi>in the forme of God, when after his baptisme, He undertooke the worke of his publike Ministry, and wrought mighty workes in the world:</hi> which forme he ceased to be in, when he was taken in the Garden, and exposed <hi>as a servant</hi> to all manner of reproach.</p>
               <p>That there is not any thing in this whole exposition, Answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> the minde of the Holy Ghost, is evident as from what was said before; so also 1. Because it is said of Christ, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>He was in the forme of God,</hi> before he tooke the <hi>forme of a servant,</hi> and yet the taking of the <hi>forme of a servant</hi> in this place, doth evidently answer his <hi>being made flesh,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. his being made in the <hi>likenesse of sinfull flesh,</hi> Rom 8. 3. his <hi>comeing</hi> or being <hi>sent</hi> into the world, Math. 10. 11. 20. 28.

So farre it signifies that which is <hi>internall and hidden,</hi> or not visibly discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, in as much as the <hi>Essence</hi> of God is invisible. The proofes of this I shall not now repeat. 2. Christs <hi>power of working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> was not <hi>visible,</hi> though the miracles He wrought were <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;</hi> insomuch, that it was the great Question between him, and the Jewes, by what <hi>power</hi> He wrought his Miracles; for they still pleaded, that he cast out Divells by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> the Prince of the Divels.

If to be in the <hi>forme of God,</hi> and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be <hi>equall to him,</hi> be to have <hi>power,</hi> or <hi>Authority,</hi> of <hi>healing disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> casting out Divels, raising the dead, and the like; then the <hi>Apostles</hi> were in the <hi>forme</hi> of God, and <hi>equall</hi> to God, having power and Authority given them for all these things, which they wought accordingly; <hi>casting out Divels, healing the diseased, raising the dead, &amp;c.</hi> which whether it be not <hi>blasphemy</hi> to affirme, the reader may judge. 4. It is true, God sayes of <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod. 7. 1. <hi>I have made thee a God to Pharaoh;</hi> which is expounded c. 4. 16. where God tels him, that <hi>Aaron</hi> should be to him <hi>insteed</hi> of a <hi>mouth,</hi> &amp; he should be to him <hi>insteed of God.</hi> That is, <hi>Aaron</hi> should speak &amp; deliver to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> &amp; the <hi>people,</hi> what God <hi>revealed</hi> to <hi>Moses, Moses</hi> revealing it to <hi>Aaron; Aaron</hi> receiving his message from <hi>Moses,</hi> as other Prophets did from God, whence he is said to be to him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steed of God: And this is given as the reason of that expression, c. 7. 1. of his being a God to <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> even as our Saviour speakes, because the <hi>word of God came by him;</hi> because he should reveale the will of God to him. <hi>Thou shalt be a God to Praraoh, and Aaron thy Brother shall be thy Prophet; Thou shalt speake all that I command thee, and Aaron thy Brother shall speake to Pharaoh.</hi> He is not upon the account of his <hi>working miracles</hi> called God, or said to be in the <hi>forme of God,</hi> or to be made <hi>equall</hi> to God; but revealing the will of God to <hi>Aaron,</hi> who spake it to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he is said to be a <hi>God to Pharaoh,</hi> or in the <hi>stead of God,</hi> as to that businesse. 5. It is true, the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This Harmony of the description of Christ here, both as to <note place="margin">§. 36.</note> his person and Office, with what is elsewhere spoken of him, (this being evidently a summary collection of what is more largely in the Gospell spoken of) makes it evident, that he is <hi>God,</hi> here intended: which is all that is needfull to be evinced from this place.</p>
               <p>Let us now heare our Catechists pleading for themselves. <note place="margin">§. 37.</note>
                  <hi>What doest thou Answer</hi> to 1 Tim. 3. 16? <note place="margin">Adtertium vero quid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondes?</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>1. That in many antient Copies, and in the vulgar Latine it selfe, the word, <hi>God,</hi> is not read; <note place="margin">Primum quidem, quod in multis exemplaribus vetustis &amp; in ipsa vulgata, non legatur vox Deus. Quare ex eo loco certum nihil concludi potest. Deinde, etiamsi ea vox lege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur, nullam esse causam cur ad Patrem referri non possit, cùm haee de Patre affirmari possint, eum apparuisse in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto, &amp; Apostolis qui caro fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt. Quod autem inferiùs le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur, secundum usitatam ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionem, receptus est in glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, id in Graeco habetur, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptus est in gloria, id est, cum gloria, aut gloriosè.</note> wherefore from that place nothing certaine can be concluded. 2. Although that word should be read, yet there is no cause why it should not be referred to the Father, seeing these things may be affirmed of the Father: that he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in Christ, and the Apostles, who were flesh: &amp; for what is afterwards read, according to the usuall translation, He was received into Glory, in the Greeke it is, He was received in Glory, that is, with Glory, or Gloriously.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What then is the sence of this Testimony?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Religion of Christ is full of Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: for God, that is, his will, for the saving <note place="margin">Quae verò futura est hujus testimonii sententia?</note> of men, was perfectly made known by infirme &amp; mortall men; and yet because of the Miracles <note place="margin">Religionem Christi plenane esse mysteriis. Nam Deus, id est, voluntas ipsius de servan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis hominibus, per komines infirmos &amp; mortales perfectè patefacta est: &amp; nihilominus tamen propter miracula, &amp; virtutes varias, quae per homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes illes infirmes &amp; mortales edita fuerant, pro vera est ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita: eadem ab ipsis Angelis fuit demum perspecta; non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Judaeis, verum etiam gentibus fuit praedicata: omnes ei crediderunt, &amp; insignem in modum, &amp; summa cum gloria recepta fuit.</note> and various powerfull workes, which were performed by such weake mortall men, it [was acknowledged for true, and it was at length perceived by the Angells themselves, and was preached not only to the Jewes, but also to the Gentiles; all Believed thereon, and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great glory after an eminent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</q>

               <p>Thus they; meerly rather then say nothing, or yeild to the truth. Briefely to remove what they offer in way of Exception or Assertion.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though the word <hi>God,</hi> be not in the <hi>vulgar latine,</hi> yet <note place="margin">§. 39.</note> the unanimous constant consent of all the Originall Copies, confessed to be so, both by <hi>Beza,</hi> and <hi>Erasmus,</hi> is sufficient to evince, that the losse of that word in that translation, is not of any import to weaken the sence of the place. Of other <hi>antient</hi> copies whereof they boast, they cannot instance one; in the vulgar also, it is evident, that by the <hi>Mystery,</hi> Christ is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That what is here spoken <hi>MAY be referred to the Father,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 40.</note> is a very sorry shift, against the evidence of all those considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which shew, that it <hi>OƲGHT</hi> to be referred to the <hi>Son.</hi>

How was he <hi>manifested in the flesh,</hi> how was he <hi>justifyed in the Spirit,</hi> how was He <hi>taken up into glory?</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="2">2. For the sence they tender of these words; Let them 1. Give any one instance, where <hi>God,</hi> is put for the <hi>will of God,</hi>

From the opposition here made to <hi>Angels,</hi> or the <hi>Angelicall nature;</hi> the Holy Ghost shewing, that the businesse of Christ being to save his Church by dying for them, was not therefore to take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him an <hi>Angelicall, spirituall substance,</hi> or nature, but the nature of man. 3. The same thing is elsewhere in like manner expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed: as where He is said to be made of the <hi>seed of David according to the flesh, Rom:</hi> 1. 3. and to <hi>come of the Fathers as concerning the flesh, Rom:</hi> 9. 5. 4.

Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I, 2 Cor.</hi> 11. 22. 2. For the sence assgined; it is evident, that in these words the Apostle treats not of the <hi>help given,</hi> but of the <hi>way whereby</hi> Christ came to help his Church, and the means thereof; his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:115372:199"/> helping and relieving of them is mentioned in the next verse. 2. Here is no mention in this verse of <hi>Believers being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to Afflictions and Death,</hi> so that these words of theirs may serve for an Exposition of some other place of Scripture, (as they say of <hi>Gregories</hi> Comment on <hi>Job</hi>) but not of this. 3. By <hi>partaking of Flesh and Blood,</hi> is not meant <hi>primarily,</hi> being <hi>obnoxious to death and afflictions;</hi> nor doth that expression in any place sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify any such thing; though such a nature, as is so obnoxious, be intended.

It is very probable, that the intendment of the Apostle was to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the <hi>Abomination</hi> of them, who denyed Christ to be a <hi>true man,</hi> but assigned him a <hi>phantasticall</hi> body, which yet he so doth, as to expresse his <hi>coming in the flesh</hi> in such a manner, as eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces him to have another nature (as was said) besides that which is here <hi>Synecdothically</hi> called flesh.

That Christ is not God, because He is <hi>not the Person of the Father;</hi> that he is not God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>He is man,</hi> is the summe of their Answer. And yet these men knew, that we insisted on these Testimonies to prove him God, <hi>though He be man,</hi> and though He be <hi>not the same Person</hi> with the Father. 2. They do all along impose upon us their own most <hi>false hypothesis;</hi> That Christ is <hi>God,</hi> although He be <hi>not God by Nature.</hi> Those who are not God <hi>by Nature,</hi> and yet pretend to be Gods, are <hi>Idols,</hi> and shall be destroyed. And they only are the men, who affirme there are <hi>two Gods;</hi> one who is <hi>so by Nature,</hi> and another <hi>made</hi> so, one indeed God, and no man, the other <hi>a man▪</hi> and <hi>no God:</hi> the Lord our God, is one God. 3. In particular, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 1. the <hi>Word</hi> is Christ, as hath been above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly demonstrated. Christ in respect of another nature, that he had before <hi>He took flesh, and dwelt with men:</hi> v. 14. Herein is He said to be <hi>with the Father,</hi> in respect of his <hi>distinct personall subsistence,</hi> who was one with the Father, as to his <hi>nature and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</hi>
                  <pb n="317" facs="tcp:115372:202"/> And this is that which we prove from this Testimony, which will not be warded with a bare deniall. <hi>The word was with God, and the word was God. God by nature,</hi> and <hi>with God in his personall distinction. 4. Thomas</hi> confesses him to be his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> in whose <hi>hands</hi> and <hi>feet</hi> he <hi>saw the print of the nailes;</hi> as God is said to Redeem the Church with his own blood. He was the <hi>Lord and God of Thomas,</hi> who in his humane nature shed his blood, and had the print of the nailes in his hands and feet. Of this <hi>confession</hi> of <hi>Thomas</hi> I have spoken before; &amp; therefore I shall not now farther insist upon it. He whom <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Confession of his faith,</hi> as a <hi>Believer,</hi> owned for his <hi>Lord and God,</hi> He is the true God, God by nature; of a <hi>made God, a God by Office,</hi> to be confessed and believed in, the Scripture is utterly silent. 5. The same is affirmed of Ro. 9. 5. The Apostle distinguishes of Christ, as to his <hi>flesh▪</hi> and as to his <hi>Deity;</hi> as to his <hi>flesh, or humane nature,</hi> he sayes, he was of the <hi>Fathers;</hi> but in the other regard He is <hi>God over all blessed for ever.</hi> And as this is a signall expression of the <hi>true</hi> God, God <hi>over all blessed for ever,</hi> so there is no occasion of that expression, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>sh,</hi> but to assert some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Christ,</hi> which he afterwards affirmes to be his everlasting Deity, in regard whereof he is not of the Fathers. He is then of the Fathers, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. The words are most <hi>emphatically</hi> expressive of the Eternall Deity of Christ, in contradistinction to what he received of the Fathers: <gap reason="foreign">

It is evident, that the Apostle intends to ascribe to Christ here, two most solemne Attributes of God; the <hi>most High,</hi> and the <hi>Blessed</hi> one. Nor is this Testimony to be parted with for their begging, or with their importunity. 6. It is our Adversaries who say, there are two Gods, as hath been shewed, not we; and the <hi>prints of wounds</hi> are proper to him who is God by nature, though not in that regard, on the account whereof he is so. 7. What they have said to oppose the distinction of <hi>two natures,</hi> in the <hi>one Person</hi> of Christ, hath already been considered, and manifested to be false and frivolous.</p>
               <p>I could wish to these Testimonies they had added one or<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> two more; as that of <hi>Isaiah 54. 5. Thy maker is thine Husband,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:115372:203"/> the Lord of Hosts is his name, and thy Redeemer the Holy one of Israel, the God of the whole Earth shall He be called.</hi> That Jesus Christ is the <hi>Husband</hi> &amp; <hi>Spouse</hi> of the Church, will not be denyed, <hi>Eph: 5. 25. Revel:</hi> 21. 9. but he who is so, is <hi>the Lord of Hosts, the God of Israel, the Lord of the whole Earth.</hi> And <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 4. the Apostle saies, that▪ <hi>He that made all things is God;</hi> that is, <hi>his Church;</hi> for of that he treats: He that <hi>created all things,</hi> that is, <hi>the Church, as well as all other things,</hi> He is God; none could do it but God: <hi>but Christ built this house:</hi> v. 3. But this is not my present imployment.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>From all these Attributes of Christ a divine nature can by no meanes be proved. For as to the first, it is notorious that <hi>Peter</hi> confessed that the Son of man was Christ, and the Son of the Living God, who as it is evident, had not such a divine nature as they feigne. Besides, the Scripture testifyeth of other men, that they are the Sons of the Living God: as the Apostle out of <hi>Hosea, Ro.</hi> 9 26. and as to what belongeth to the second and third places, in them we read that the proper and only begotten Sonne of God was delivered to death, which cannot be said of him who is God by nature. Yea from hence that Christ is the Sonne of God, it appeares that he is not God: for otherwise he should be Sonne to himselfe. But the cause why these Attributes belong to Christ is this, that he is the chiefest, and most deare to God among all the Sonnes of God: as <hi>Isaac,</hi> because he was most deare to <hi>Abraham</hi> and was his heire is called his only begotten sonne <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 17. although he had his brother <hi>Ishmael:</hi> and <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the only begotteen of his Mother, although he had many brethren by the same Mother: 1 <hi>Chron. 3. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

On what account Christ <hi>is,</hi> and on what account alone He <hi>is called the Sonne of God,</hi> hath been sufficiently demonstrated: and his unity of nature with his Father thence evinced. It is true 1. That <hi>Peter</hi> calls Christ, who was the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> the <hi>Sonne of the living God.</hi> Not <hi>in</hi> that, or <hi>on</hi> that account whereon he is the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> but because he is peculiarly in respect of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other nature, then that wherein he is the <hi>Sonne of man,</hi> the Sonne of the <hi>Living God.</hi> And if <hi>Peter</hi> had intended no more in this Assertion, but only that he was <hi>one</hi> among the <hi>many</hi> Sonnes of God, How doth he answer that <hi>Question,</hi> but whom say <hi>ye</hi> that I am? being exceptive to what others said, who yet affirmed that he was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> one <hi>come out from God,</hi> and favoured of him. It is evident, that it is something much more <hi>noble</hi> and <hi>divine</hi> that is here affirmed by him, in this solemne confession of him, on whom the Church is built. It is true, Believers are called <hi>Children of the living God, Rom.</hi> 9. 26. in opposition to the <hi>Idols</hi> whom they served before their Conversion; neither doe we argue from this expression barely, of the <hi>Living God,</hi> but in conjunction with those other that follow, and in the <hi>Emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calnesse</hi> of it, in this confession of <hi>Peter,</hi> Christ instantly affirming that this was a <hi>Rocke,</hi> which should not be prevailed against. 2. What is meant by the <hi>proper and only begotten Sonne of God</hi> hath been already abundantly evinced; nor is it disproved by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>that the proper and only Sonne of God was given to death;</hi> for so he was, and thereby God redeemed his <hi>Church with his own blood.</hi> He that is the <hi>proper and only begotten</hi> Sonne of God, was given to death, though not in that nature, and in respect of that wherein he is the <hi>proper and only begotten Son of God.</hi> 3. Christ is the <hi>Sonne of the Father,</hi> who is God, and therein the <hi>Sonne of God,</hi> without any danger of being the <hi>Sonne of himselfe,</hi> that is, of God as he is the Sonne. This is a <hi>begging</hi> the thing in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, without offering any plea for what they pretend to, but their own unbeliefe, and carnall apprehensions of the things of God. 4. Our <hi>Catechists</hi> have exceedingly forgotten themselves, and their <hi>Masters,</hi> in affirming, that Christ is called the <hi>proper and only begotten Sonne of God,</hi> because he is most <hi>deare</hi> to God of all his Sonnes; themselves and their <hi>Master</hi> having as
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:115372:205"/> was shewed at large before, given us reasons quite of another nature for this appellation, which we have discussed &amp; disproved elsewhere. 5. If Christ be the <hi>only begotten Sonne of God,</hi> only on this account, because he is most <hi>deare among all the Sonnes of God,</hi> then He is the Sonne of God upon the same account with them; that is, by <hi>Regeneration and Adoption;</hi> which that it is most false hath been shewed elsewhere. Christ is the <hi>proper, naturall, only begotten Sonne of God,</hi> in contradistinction to all others, the <hi>Adopted</hi> Sonnes of God, as was wade manifest. <hi>Isaac</hi> is called the <hi>only begotten</hi> Sonne of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not absolutely, but in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the <hi>Promise:</hi> He was his <hi>only begotten Sonne</hi> to whom the <hi>Promise</hi> did belong: <hi>He that received the promise offered up his only begotten Sonne. Solomon</hi> is not said to be the <hi>only begotten</hi> of his Mother, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4. 3. but only <hi>before the face,</hi> or <hi>in the sight</hi> of his Mother; eminently expressing his preferment a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Neither can it hence be gathered that Christ hath a divine Nature: for seeing Christ is the first borne of every Creature, it is necessary that he be one of the number of the Creatures. For that is the force of the word first borne in the Scriptures, that it is of necessity, that he who is first borne, be one of the number of them of whom he is the first borne: <hi>Col. 1. 18. Rom. 8. 29. Apoc.</hi> 1. 5. Neither that our Lord Jesus was one of the things created in the old Creation, can our Adversaries grant, unlesse they will be Arians: it behoveth them that they grant
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:115372:206"/> him to be one of the new Creation. From whence not only the divine nature of Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be proved, but also that Christ hath no such Divine nature is firmely evinced. But now that Jesus is called by that name▪ by the Apostle it is from hence, that in time &amp; worth he far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth all other things of the new Creation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That by the <hi>Creation,</hi> in this verse, and the things annume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> to be created in the verses following, is intended the <hi>Creation of the world,</hi> and all things therein visible, &amp; invisible, was before abundantly evinced, in the consideration of the ensuing verses, &amp; the exceptions of these <hi>Catechists</hi> wholy removed, from being any hinderance to the embracing of the first obvious <hi>sence</hi> of the words. All then that is here infer'd from a supposition of the <hi>new Creation</hi> being here intended, (which is a most <hi>vaine supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) falls to the <hi>ground</hi> of it selfe: So that I shall not need to take the least farther notice of it. 2. That Christ is so the <hi>first borne of the old Creation,</hi> as to be a Prince, Heire, and Lord of it, and the things thereof, which is the sence of the word as here used &amp; yet not one▪ of them is evident from the Context: The very next words to these, <hi>He is the first borne of every Creature,</hi> are, <hi>and by him all things were created.</hi> He by whom all things, all Creatures were Created, is no Creature; for he else must create himselfe. And so we are neither <hi>Arians,</hi> nor <hi>Photinians:</hi> Though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer have more colour of saving themselves from the sword of the word, then the latter, yet they both perish by it. 3. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>first borne,</hi> in this place is <hi>Metaphoricall:</hi> and the expression is intended to set out the excellency of Christ above all other things. That that is the designe of the Holy Ghost in the place, is confessed. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the word may import two things concerning him of whom it is spoken; First that he is one of them in reference to whom He is said to be the <hi>first borne:</hi> Or 2. that he hath <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Preheminence, Rule, and inheritance</hi> of them and over them; I aske which of these significations suits the Apostles ayme here, to set out the Excellency of Christ, above all Creatures; that
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:115372:206"/> which makes him <hi>one</hi> of them, or that which exalts him <hi>above</hi> them. 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is, <hi>begotten before</hi> all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or every creature. The Apostle doth not say, Christ was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the first of them made, but he was borne or begotten before them all, that is, from eternity. His being begotten, is opposed to the creation of all other things. And though the word, where expresse mention is made of others, in the same kind, may denote <hi>one</hi> of them, yet where it is used con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning things so far distant, &amp; which are not <hi>compared,</hi> but <hi>one</hi> preferred above the <hi>other,</hi> it requires no such signification. See <hi>Job. 18. 13. Ps. 89. 27. Jer. 31. 9. Grotius</hi> is perfectly agreed with our <hi>Catechists,</hi> and uses their very words in the exposition of this place; but that also hath been considered, and his expositions called to an account formerly.</p>

The subject matter Chap. 16. is that which the Holy Spirit was to reveale to the Apostles, which belonged to the Kingdome of Christ. And Chap. 17. it is most apparent that he treateth of his Disciples, whom God gave him, whom he calls his. Moreover seeing that whatever Christ hath, He hath it by gift from the Father, and not of himselfe, it hence appeareth, that he can by no meanes have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, when he who is God by nature hath all things of himselfe.</q>

Christ saith; <hi>All things that the Father hath are mine, therefore said I he shall take of mine, and shew it unto you.</hi> Now if all things that the Father hath, are his, then the <hi>Divine nature is his,</hi> for the Father hath a <hi>divine nature.</hi> But they say, this <hi>All things, is to be expounded according to the subject matter treated of,</hi> that is, only what the Holy Ghost was to reveale to the Apostles. Let thē the expression be expounded according to the <hi>subject matter.</hi> Christ renders a Reason why he said that the Spirit should <hi>take of his,</hi> even because what he had of the Father, He had also of him; all that the Father hath being his. Now it was the <hi>knowledge of all truth,</hi> and all things to come, and all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Kingdome of Christ, that he was thus to shew to the Apostles.

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115372:208"/> their cause. The words of the verse are: <hi>For unto us a Child is borne, unto us a Sonne is given, and the Goverment shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderfull, Councellour, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Our Catechists confessing that this is spoken of Christ, and<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> that he is here called the <hi>Everlasting Father,</hi> (they are more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest then <hi>Grotius,</hi> whose labour to corrupt this place, is to be bewayled; having ventured on the words, as farre as any of the <hi>moderne Rabbines,</hi> who yet make it their businesse to divert this Text from being applyed to the <hi>Messiah,</hi>) have saved me the labour of proving from the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Context,</hi> that he only can possibly be intended. This then being taken for granted: this is that which is here affirmed of him, that his <hi>name shall be called,</hi> or He <hi>shall be,</hi> &amp; <hi>shall be known to be</hi> (for both these are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this expression) <hi>Wonderfull, Councellour, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> He who is the <hi>mighty God,</hi> &amp; the <hi>Everlasting Father,</hi> is God by nature; but so is Jesus Christ. The expression here used of the <hi>Mighty God,</hi> is ascribed to <hi>God, Deut. 10. 17. Nehem. 9. 32. Jerem.</hi> 32. 18. and is a most eminent name of God; a name discriminating him from all that are <hi>not God</hi> by nature. And this may be added to the other names of God, that are attributed to Christ: as <hi>Adonai, Psal. 110. 1. Elohim, Psal. 46. 5. Heb. 1. 8. Jehovah, Jerem. 23. 6. Chap. 33. 16. Mal. 3. 1.

               <p>Here begins the exposition. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> is intended. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> say some of the <hi>Rabbins.</hi> But 1.

               <p n="2">2. It is true, that the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphrast applyes this<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> Prophesy unto the <hi>Messiah,</hi> whose words are. <hi>Dicit propheta Domui David; Quoniam parvulus natus est nobis, Filius datus est nobis, &amp; suscepit legem super se, ut servaret eam; &amp; vocabitur nomen ejus, a facie admirabilis consilii Deus, vir permanens in aeternum: Christus cujuus pax multiplicabitur super nos in diebus ejus.</hi> He not only referrs the whole to <hi>Christ,</hi> without any intimation of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> but says also, that his name shall be, the <hi>God of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell.</hi>

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115372:212"/> is therefore called the Word of God, because He expounds to us the whole will of God, as <hi>John</hi> there declares a little after, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 18. as He is also in the same sence said to be life and Truth.</q>

                  </gap>, his Eternall <hi>Essentiall</hi> Word, or wisdome. Let our <hi>Catechists</hi> prove another acceptation of the Word in any place. That Christ is not the <hi>Word</hi> spoken by God, they will grant, for He was a <hi>Person</hi> that revealed to us the word of God. He is then Gods <hi>Eternall Word,</hi> or Wisdome, and so consequently God. 2. Christ is so called the <hi>Word</hi> of God, (<hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 1.) as that He is in the same place said <hi>to be God.</hi> And our Adversaries are indeed <hi>too impudent,</hi> whereas they say, <hi>if He be the word of the one God, He cannot be the One God;</hi> the Holy Ghost affirming the flat contrary, namely, that He <hi>was the Word, and was with God, and was God:</hi> that is doubtlesse the one true God, v. 1, 2, 3. He <hi>was with God,</hi> in his Person, as the Son, and He was God as to his nature. 3. Christ is not called the <hi>Word, Ioh.</hi> 1. 1. upon the account of his actuall revealing the word of God to us, in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son on the Earth, (which He did v. 18.) because he is called so in his everlasting <hi>residence</hi> with the Father, before the World was, v. 1. Nor is He so called on that account, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. 13. it being applied to him, in reference to the <hi>worke of executing Judgement</hi> on his enemies, as a <hi>King,</hi> and not his revealing the word of God, as a <hi>Prophet.</hi> So that notwithstanding this Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this name of the <hi>Word of God,</hi> applied to Christ, as in the places mentioned, proves him to have a <hi>divine nature,</hi> and to be God blessed for ever.</p>

And though the Scriptures do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times say of the Father, by him are all things, yet these words are to be taken otherwise of the Father, then of the Sonne.

That I need not to remember, that the word <hi>all things,</hi> as was shewed above, is to be referred to the subject matter. Which that it is so appeareth hence, that the Apostle dealeth of al those things which belong to the Christian people, as these two words, [<hi>to us,</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi>] do declare. Whence it is proved, that Christ is not simply and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely, but in some certaine respect, called the one Lord, by whom are all things.

               <p>It is very evident, that they are much entangled with this<note place="margin">§. 66.</note> Testimony, which necessitates them to turne themselves into all manner of shapes, to try whether they can shift their bonds, and escape or no.

               <p n="1">1. It is true, Christ is differenced clearely from the Father,<note place="margin">§. 67.</note> as to his <hi>Person,</hi> here spoken of; but that they have proved the Father to be the <hi>only God by nature, exclusively</hi> to the Sonne, and Holy Ghost, is but a <hi>boasting</hi> before they <hi>put off their harnesse.</hi> It is true, the Father is said here to be the <hi>one</hi> God, which no more hinders the Sonne from being <hi>so</hi> too, then the Assertion that the Sonne is the <hi>one</hi> Lord, denyes the Fathers being <hi>so</hi> also.</p>

The places are worth the consideration, I shall only propose them, &amp; then consider their Answer.</p>
               <p>The first is Is. 8. 13, 14. <hi>Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himselfe, let him</hi>

In all which places that Prophesy is repeated. Christ
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:115372:217"/> therefore is the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> whom we are to sanctify in our heart, and to make him our <hi>dread, and our feare.</hi>

Rev. 1. 7. <hi>Every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him:</hi> He then is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the Lord of Hosts. <hi>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, not a bone of him shall be broken. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, another Scripture saith they shall look on him whom they have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.</hi> Joh. 19. 36, 37. It is as I said beyond dispute, that it is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the only true God that spake, and what he spoke of himselfe is fulfilled in Jesus Christ.</p>

Wherefore he saith, when He ascended up on high, He led captivity captive and gave gifts to men▪ Now that he ascended, what is it, but that he also

               <p>
                  <hi>Grotius</hi> on both these places sayes; that what is <hi>properly spoken of God,</hi> is by <hi>Paul mystically</hi> applyed to Christ: to the same pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose with what our <hi>Catechists</hi> afterwards insist on. That it is the same person who is intended in both places, and not that <hi>applyed</hi> to <hi>one,</hi> which was <hi>spoken</hi> of <hi>another</hi> (which is most evident in the Context) He takes no notice. There being nothing of plea or Argument in his <hi>Annotations,</hi> against our Testimonies from hence, but only an indeavour to divert the meaning of the places to another sence, I shall not insist longer on them.</p>

               </p>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:115372:218"/>
               <p>And this is their defence: the Answer they fix upon to all<note place="margin">§. 87.</note> the Testimonies recited: wherein how little Truth or strength there is, will quickly appeare. 1. These Scriptures perhaps <hi>may</hi> be Answered thus or thus, as what will not the serpentine wits of men find out, to wrest the Word withall to their own destruction? But the question is, how they ought to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted, and what is their sence and intendment. 2. We doe not say, that what is spoken of <hi>God</hi> under the Law, is <hi>accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated</hi> to Christ under the Gospell; but that the things instanced in, that were spoken of <hi>God,</hi> were then spoken of Christ, as to his nature wherein He is God; which appeares by the event, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in the Bookes of the New Testament. The Scripture doth not say in the New Testament of Christ, what was said in the Old of God; but evinces those things which were so spoken of God, to have been spoken of Christ. So that 3. The folly of that pretence, that what was spoken of <hi>God</hi> is referred to <hi>Christ,</hi> upon the account of the <hi>conjunction</hi> mentioned, which whatever it be, is a thing of naught in comparison of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that is between the <hi>Creatour</hi> and a meere creature, is manifest; for let any one be in never so neare conjunction with God, yet if he be not God, what is <hi>spoken of God,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> it is spoken of <hi>God,</hi> and denoting <hi>God</hi> only, cannot be spoken of him; nor indeed accommodated to him. 4. The instances of <hi>Moses</hi> are most remote from the businesse in hand: It is said of <hi>Moses,</hi> that he brought the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and so he did, as their chiefe <hi>Leader and Ruler,</hi> so that he was a <hi>Redeemer</hi> to that people, as he was instrumentall in the hand of God, working by his power and Presence with him those mighty workes, which made way for their deliverance and Redemption. But where is it said of <hi>Moses,</hi> or any one else, that he was God; that what God said of himselfe, was said of <hi>Moses</hi> &amp; accomplished in him? Or where ever did <hi>Moses</hi> speak in the name of <hi>God,</hi> and say, <hi>I Jehovah</hi> will do this, and this, or be so, and so, unto my people? 5. It is true, men may be said to <hi>do</hi> in their place and kind of operation, what God doth do; He as the <hi>principall efficient,</hi> they as the <hi>Instrumentall</hi> cause, and so may every other creature in the world; as the <hi>Sunne</hi> gives light and heat; but shall therefore that which God speakes in his own name of himselfe, be so much as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:115372:218"/> unto them? 6. The <hi>Conjunction</hi> that is between God and Christ, according to to our <hi>Catechists,</hi> is but of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> on the <hi>part of God,</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> and dependance on the part of Christ; but this in the same kind, though not in the same <hi>degree,</hi> is between God &amp; all Believr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s; so that of them also, what is spoken of God may be spoken.</p>
               <p>And thus, through the presence of God, have I gone through<note place="margin">§. 88.</note> with the consideration of all the Testimonies, given in the Scripture to the Deity of Christ, which these <hi>Catechists</hi> thought good to take notice of; with a full Answer to their long Chap. <hi>de Persona Christi.</hi> The Learned Reader knows how much all the Arguments we insist on, and the Testimonies we produce in this cause, might have been improved to a greater <hi>Advantage</hi> of clearnesse and evidence, had I taken liberty to handle them, as they naturally fall into severall heads, from the Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the <hi>Names,</hi> and <hi>Properties,</hi> all the <hi>Workes,</hi> and <hi>Lawes,</hi> all the <hi>Worship,</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> of God, to be given and ascribed to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. But the worke I had to doe cast my endeavour in this businesse into that order and method, wherein it is here presented to the Reader.</p>
               <p>The conclusion of our Catechists is a long <hi>Harangue,</hi> wherein<note place="margin">§. 89.</note> they labour to insinuate the <hi>prejudicialnesse</hi> of our Doctrine to the <hi>true knowledge</hi> of Christ, and the obtaining of Salvation by him, with the certain foundation that is laid in theirs, for the participation of all the benefits of the Gospell. The only <hi>medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> they fix upon, for to gaine both these ends by, is this, that <hi>we deny Christ to be a true man,</hi> which they assert. That the first of these is <hi>notoriously</hi> false, is known to all other men, and is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in their own Consciences. Of the truth of the latter elsewhere. He that had a perfect <hi>humane nature,</hi> Soule and body, with all the naturall and essentiall properties of them both; He who was borne so, lived so, dyed so, rose againe so, was, and is a perfect man; So that all the benefits that we do, or may receive from <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> as a <hi>perfect man,</hi> like unto us in all things, <hi>sinne only excepted,</hi> there is a way open for, in this our Confession of him. In the mean time, the great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Faith, Hope, and Expectation lyes in this, that <hi>He is the Sonne of the Living God,</hi> and so, that <hi>God redeemed his Church with his own bloud;</hi> He who was of the Fathers, <hi>according

It is true, perhaps as <hi>a meer man</hi> He might do all that our <hi>Catechists</hi> acknowledge him to have done, and accomplish all that they expect from him; but for us, who fly to him, as one that <hi>suffered for our sinnes,</hi> and made <hi>satisfaction</hi> to the justice of God for them, who wrought out a <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> that is rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to all that believe, that <hi>quickens</hi> us when we are <hi>dead,</hi> and sends the Holy Ghost to dwell and abide in us, and is himselfe present with us, &amp;c. It is impossible we should ever have the least consolation in our <hi>flying for refuge</hi> to him, unlesse we had this grounded perswasion concerning his Eternall Power and Godhead. We cannot think He was <hi>made</hi> the Sonne of God, and a <hi>God,</hi> upon the account of what he did for us; but that <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God,</hi> and the <hi>Son of God,</hi> herein was his Love made manifest, that he was <hi>made flesh,</hi> took upon him the <hi>forme of a servant,</hi> and became therein for us <hi>obedient unto death, the death of the Crosse.</hi> Many indeed and inexpressible are the encouragements unto Faith, and Consolation in believing, that we do receive from Christs being made <hi>like</hi> to us, a <hi>perfect man,</hi> wherein he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went what we were obnoxious unto, and whereby He knowes how to be compassionate unto us; but that any sweetnesse can be hence derived unto any, who do refuse to own the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whence all the streames of Love and Mercy, that runne in the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ do flow, that we deny. Yea that our Adversaries in this businesse have any foundation for faith Love, or Hope, or can have any acceptance with God, or with Jesus Christ, but rather that they are cursed on the one hand for robbing him of the Glory of his <hi>Deity,</hi> and on the other for putting their confidence in a <hi>man,</hi> we dayly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate from innumerable Testimonies of Scripture. And for these men, the truth is, as they lay out the choicest of all their endeavoures to prove him not to be God by nature, and so not at all, (for a <hi>made God, a second-rank God, a Deifyed man,</hi> is no God, the Lord our God being one, and the conceit of it brings in the <hi>Polutheisme</hi> of the Heathen amongst the professors of the name of Christ) so they also deny him to be <hi>true man,</hi> now he is in Heaven, or to retaine the nature of a man: and so insteed of <hi>a</hi> Christ that was God from Eternity, made a man in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:115372:219"/> unto Eternity, they believe in a Christ, who <hi>was a man,</hi> and is <hi>made a God,</hi> who never had the <hi>nature of God,</hi> and had then the nature of man, but hath <hi>lost</hi> it. This M. <hi>B.</hi> after his Masters, instructs his Disciples in, in his lesser <hi>Catechisme</hi> C. 10. namely, that although <hi>Christ rose with his fleshly body,</hi> wherein he was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifyed, yet now he hath a <hi>spirituall Body,</hi> not in its <hi>qualityes,</hi> but substance; a body that hath neither <hi>flesh nor bones.</hi> What he hath done with his other body, where he laid it aside, or how he disposed of it, he doth not declare.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>How many Holy Spirits of Christians are there?</hi> Ans. <hi>One spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> Eph. 4. 4.</p>
                  <p>I must take leave to put <hi>one</hi> Question to M. <hi>B.</hi> that we may the better know the mind and meaning of <hi>his:</hi> and that is; What he means by the <hi>Holy Spirits</hi> of Christians: If he intend that Spirit which they <hi>worship,</hi> invocate, believe, and are <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi> into his name, who <hi>quickens,</hi> and sanctifies them, and from whom they have their supplies of Grace; it is true, there is but <hi>one only Spirit</hi> of Christians, as is evident, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4, 4. and this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is <hi>God blessed for ever:</hi> nor can any be called that <hi>one Spirit of Christians,</hi> but he that is so. But if by the <hi>Holy Spirits</hi> of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, He intends <hi>created Spirituall beings,</hi> sent out of God for the good of Christians, of those that believe, there are then an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of Holy Spirits</hi> of Believers; for all the Angells are <hi>ministring Spirits, sent forth to minister for them, who shall be heirs of Salvation, Heb.</hi> 1. 13, 14 So that by this one Testimony, that there is but <hi>one Holy Spirit</hi> of Christians, that <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the number of all <hi>created Spirits,</hi> and reckoned as
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:115372:220"/> the object of their worship, with the one God, and one Lord; <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 4, 5, 6. When yet they worship the Lord their <hi>God alone,</hi> and <hi>him only do they serve, Mat.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
                  <p>His second Q. is, <hi>Wherein consists the Prerogative of that Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>
                     <hi>above other Spirits.</hi> Ans. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 10, 11.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prerogative</hi> of that Holy Spirit, of whom we speake, is, that of <hi>God</hi> above his <hi>Creature:</hi> the <hi>Prerogative</hi> of an Infinite, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, Selfe-subsisting Being. Yea and that this is indeed his <hi>Prerogative,</hi> we need not seek for proofe beyond that Testimony here produced by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>
                     <hi>B.</hi> (though to another purpose) in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to his Question. He that <hi>searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God,</hi> is God. To search all things is the same with <hi>knowing</hi> all things; so the Apostle interprets it in the next verse: <hi>None know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the things of God, save the Spirit of God.</hi> To <hi>know all things,</hi> is to be <hi>omniscient.</hi> But he that is <hi>Omniscient,</hi> is <hi>God.</hi> His <hi>Angels</hi> hee<note place="margin">De Adoratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Jesu Christi disputatio: p. 18, 19.</note> charged with folly. <hi>Omniscience</hi> is an essentiall Attribute of God▪ And therefore <hi>Socinus</hi> in his disputation with * <hi>Franken,</hi> durst not allow Christ to be <hi>omniscient,</hi> least he should also grant him to be <hi>Infinite</hi> in Essence. Againe; He that <hi>searches,</hi> or<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> knowes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>deep things of God,</hi> is God; None can know the <hi>deep things</hi> of an <hi>Infinite</hi> Wisdome and Understanding, but He that is Infinite. All creatures are excluded from an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the <hi>deep things</hi> of God, but only as he <hi>voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> revealeth them, <hi>Rom. 11. 34. Who hath known the mind of God, or who hath been his Counsellor?</hi> That is; no Creature hath so been; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 18. Now the Spirit doth not know the <hi>deep things of God,</hi> by his voluntary Revelation of them. For as the <hi>Spirit</hi> of a <hi>man</hi> knows the things of a Man, so doth the Spirit of God know the things of God. This is not because they are revealed to the <hi>Spirit of a man,</hi> but because that is the Principle of Operation in a man, and is conscious to all its own Actions and A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>aires. And so it is with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God;</hi> being <hi>God,</hi> and having the same Understanding, and Will, and Power with God the Father, and Sonne; as the Spirit of a man knowes the things of a man, so doth He the things of God. Thus in the <hi>beginning</hi> of <hi>this,</hi> as in the <hi>close</hi> of the last Chapter, M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B. hath provided sufficiently for his own <hi>conviction,</hi> and the scattering of all his <hi>Paralogismes,</hi> and <hi>Sophisticall</hi> insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, running through them both.</p>

                     <hi>Whence is the Holy Ghost sent?</hi> Answ. 1 Pet. 1. 12. <hi>Down from Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. This advantageth not at all M. <hi>Biddles designe</hi> against the Holy Ghost, to prove him not to be God, that he is <hi>sent down from Heaven,</hi> whereby he supposeth, that his <hi>coming</hi> from one place to another is intimated: Seeing he supposes God to be <hi>so in Heaven;</hi> yea in some <hi>certaine place</hi> of Heaven, as at the same time not to be elsewhere; so that if ever he be in the Earth, He must <hi>come down from</hi> Heaven.</p>

Where ever the <hi>Spirit</hi> is said to <hi>descend</hi> from Heaven, it is<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> to be understood according to the <hi>Analogy</hi> of what we have already spoken, concerning the presence of God in Heaven, with his <hi>Looking,</hi> and <hi>going down</hi> from thence, which I shall not repeat againe.

                  <p>The two next Question, leading only to an Expression of the<note place="margin">§. 16.</note>
                     <hi>sending of the Holy Ghost by the Father and the Son,</hi> though M. <hi>Biddles Christians</hi> differ about the interpretation of the places produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for the proofe thereof, and there ly no small Argument and Evidence of the Deity of Christ, in his <hi>sending of the Holy Ghost,</hi> as the Father sends him, yet there being an Agreement in the Expressions themselves, I shall not insist upon them. He proceeds.</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>Had Jesus Christ alwaies the power to send the Holy Ghost,</hi>

                  <p>The intendment of this Querie is, to conclude from some <hi>certaine respect and manner</hi> of sending the Holy Ghost to the thing it selfe: from the sending him in a <hi>visible, glorious,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>plentifull, eminent</hi> manner, as to the Effusion of his gifts and Graces, to the sending of him <hi>absolutely,</hi> which me thinkes a <hi>Master of Arts</hi> should know to be a <hi>Sophisticall</hi> way of arguing. 2. It endeavours also, from the <hi>Exercise</hi> of Power to conclude to the <hi>receiving</hi> of the Power it selfe; and that not the <hi>absolute</hi> Exercise of it neither, but in some certaine respect, as was spoken. This then is that, which M. <hi>Biddle</hi> concludes. Because Christ when he was exalted, or when he <hi>ascended</hi> into Heaven,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:115372:223"/> had the acomplishment of the <hi>Promise</hi> actually in the <hi>sending forth</hi> of the spirit, in that abundant and plentifull manner which was Prophesyed of by <hi>Joel</hi> Cap. 2. 28. therefore he then first <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Power</hi> to send the Spirit. Which 4. by the Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Christ himselfe is false, and not the sence of the Holy<note place="margin">Ioh. 20. 22.</note> Ghost in the places mentioned; seeing that before his <hi>Ascension</hi> he breathed on his <hi>Disciples,</hi> and bad them <hi>receive the Holy Ghost.</hi> Nay 5. that he had power of <hi>sending the Holy Ghost,</hi> and did actually <hi>send</hi> him, not only before his <hi>Ascension</hi> and Exaltation, but also before his Incarnation, is expressly affirmed 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 11. The Spirit that was in the Prophets of old,</hi> was the <hi>Spirit of Christ,</hi> and sent by him; as was that Spirit, by which he preached in the dayes of the <hi>old disobedient world;</hi> which places have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly vindicated at large. So that 6. as that place <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 32, 33. is there expounded to be concerning the <hi>plentifull effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of the gifts of the Holy spirit in the times of the Gospell, according to the prophesy of <hi>Joel:</hi> so also is that of <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39. it being positively affirmed, as to the thing it selfe, that he <hi>gave the Holy Ghost</hi> before his exaltation, though not in that <hi>abundant manner</hi> as afterwards. And so neither of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing, as to the time of Christs <hi>receiving power</hi> to send the spirit; which upon the supposition of such a worke, as for the accomplishment whereof it was necessary the Holy Ghost should be <hi>sent,</hi> he had from Eternity.</p>
                  <p>About the next <hi>Question</hi> we shall not contend. It is,<note place="margin">§. 18.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What were the generall benefits accruing to Christians by the Holy Ghost?</hi> whereunto sundry texts of Scripture, that make mention of the Holy Ghost, his <hi>graces,</hi> and <hi>gifts,</hi> are subjoyned. Upon the whole I have only some few things to <hi>animadvert.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. If by the word <hi>generall benefits,</hi> he limits the receiving of<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> those benefits of the Holy Ghost to any certain time, (as sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the time of his first plentifull effusion upon the Ascension of Jesus Christ, and the preaching of the Gospell to all Nations thereupon;) <hi>as</hi> it is a <hi>sacrilegious conception,</hi> robbing Believers of <hi>after ages,</hi> to the end of the world, of all the fruits of the efficacy of the Spirit, without which they can neither enjoy <hi>Communion</hi> with God in this Life, nor ever be brought to an eternall fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of him: So it is most <hi>false,</hi> and contrary to the expresse prayer of our Saviour▪ desiring the same things for them, <hi>who

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The things annumerated, may be called <hi>generall benefits,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> because they are <hi>common</hi> to all Believers, as to the substance, <hi>Essence,</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of them; though in respect of their degrees they are communicated variously to the severall <hi>Individuals;</hi> the same<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12. 11.</note> spirit <hi>dividing</hi> to every one as he will; they are so <hi>generall</hi> to them all, that every <hi>particular</hi> Believer enjoyes them all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Annumeration here given us, is very <hi>farre</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> from being <hi>complete;</hi> there being only some <hi>few fruits</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and priviledges, which we receive by our receiving of him, recounted: and that in a very <hi>confused manner,</hi> one thing being added after another, without any order or coherence at all. Yea of the <hi>Benefits</hi> we receive by the spirit, of the <hi>Graces</hi> he workes in us, of the <hi>Helpes</hi> he affords us, of that <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Consolation</hi> he imparts unto us, of the dayly <hi>Assistances</hi> we receive from him, of the <hi>Might</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> put forth in us, of the <hi>Efficacy</hi> of his Operations, the <hi>Constancy</hi> of his presence, the <hi>priviledges</hi> by him imparted, there is not by any in this life a full account to be given. To insist on particulars is not my present taske: I have<note place="margin">Perseverance of Saints c. 8.</note> also in part done it elsewhere.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I desire M. <hi>Biddle</hi> seriously to consider, whether even the things which he thinkes good to mention, may possibly be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to a <hi>meer Creature,</hi> or that all believers are by such an one <hi>baptized into one body;</hi> that we <hi>are all made to drinke into one Spirit, &amp;c.</hi> But of these things before. Unto this he adds,</p>
                  <p>Q. <hi>What are the speciall benefits accruing to the Apostles by the</hi>

                     <hi>Holy Ghost: and what saith Christ to them thereof?</hi> Answ. Joh. 15. 26. Act. 16. 13.</p>
                  <p>Besides the <hi>Graces</hi> of the Spirit, which the Apostles as Believers, received in a plentifull manner: they had also his Presence by his extraordinary <hi>gifts</hi> to fit them for that whole extraordinary Work, whereunto of him they were called.

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Answer is as above. To the same purpose is that of the <hi>Racovian</hi> Catechisme.</p>

                     <hi>we may believe the Gospell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ans. <hi>By no means; for we do not read in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that that gift is conferred on any, but him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the Gospell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Remove the ambiguity of that Expression, <hi>Believe the Gospell,</hi> and those <hi>two Questions</hi> perfectly fall in together. It may then be taken either for, <hi>Believing the Doctrine of the Gospell,</hi> in opposition to the Law, and in this sence it is not here enquired after; or for the <hi>power of Believing in the subject,</hi> and in that sence it is here denyed.</p>
                  <p>Now the designe of this Question is, to deny the effectuall<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> Operation of the Holy Ghost, for, &amp; in the <hi>Conversion, Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
                     <pb n="363" facs="tcp:115372:225"/> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> of the Elect, and to vindicate the whole work of Faith, Holinesse, Quickning, &amp;c. to our selves. The way designed for the proofe and establishment of this Insinuation consists, in producing sundry Testimonies, wherein it is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, that those who do believe, and are the Children of God, do <hi>receive the Spirit</hi> for other ends and purposes, then those here enumerated. The summe of his Argument is this: If they who <hi>do believe,</hi> and are the <hi>Children of God,</hi> do receive the Spirit of God, for their <hi>Adoption,</hi> and the <hi>carrying</hi> on of the work of their sanctification, with the <hi>supply</hi> of new Grace, the Confirmation and enlargement of what they have received, with <hi>Joy, Consolation,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> with other Gifts, that are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for any work or employment, that they are called unto; then the Holy Spirit doth not <hi>quicken,</hi> nor <hi>regenera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Now when M. <hi>B.</hi> proves this conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, I will confesse him to be <hi>Master</hi> of one <hi>Art,</hi> which he never learned at <hi>Oxford;</hi> unlesse it were his busines to learne what he was taught to avoyd.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B. hath one <hi>fetch</hi> of his skill more in this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> He askes, whether men <hi>do receive</hi> the Holy Ghost, when they are of the World; And for a confutation of any such Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, produceth Testimonies of Scripture, that the <hi>world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive the Holy Ghost,</hi> nor <hi>the naturall Man the things of God.</hi> But who told this <hi>Gentleman</hi> that we say, men whilest they are <hi>in,</hi> and <hi>of</hi> the World, do receive the Spirit of God, or the things of the Spirit, in the Scripture sence of the use of that word, <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving?</hi> The expression is <hi>metaphoricall,</hi> yet alwaies in the case of the things of the Gospell denoting the Actings of Faith in them, who are said to <hi>receive</hi> any thing from God. Now if this <hi>Gentleman</hi> could perswade us that we say, that we <hi>receive</hi> the Spirit by Faith, to the end that we may have <hi>Faith,</hi> he might as easily lead us about whether he pleased, as the <hi>Philistims</hi> did <hi>Sampson,</hi> when they had put out his eyes. A little then to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct</hi> this Catechist; I desire him to take notice, that properly the spirit is <hi>received by Faith,</hi> to the Ends and purposes by him mentioned, with many such others, as might be added; but yet before mens being enabled to <hi>receive</hi> it, that Spirit by his <hi>power</hi> and the efficacy of his Grace, <hi>quickneth, regenerateth,</hi> and <hi>worketh</hi>
                     <pb n="356" facs="tcp:115372:226"/> Faith in their hearts. In briefe, the Spirit is considered, and promised, either as a Spirit of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> with all the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitants, and essentiall consequents thereof; or as a Spirit of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption,</hi> and the consequents thereof. In the <hi>first</hi> sence he works in men in order of nature, antecedent to their believing; Faith being a fruit of the Spirit: In the <hi>latter,</hi> and for the ends and purposes thereof, he is received by <hi>Faith,</hi> and given in order of nature upon believing.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the <hi>World cannot receive the Spirit, nor the naturall Man</hi>

That one eminent instance shall close our Consideration of this Chapter, which we have <hi>Titus 3. 5, 6.

The deniall and rejection of the <hi>satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of Christ, is that which the man intends, as is evident from his Preface, where he denys them <hi>name</hi> and <hi>thing.</hi> This he attempts▪ partly in this Chapter, partly in that concerning the Death of Christ, and also <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Q. <hi>Is Christ our Saviour originally, and of himselfe; or because he</hi>

                     <hi>was given, exalted, and raised up by another to be a Saviour?</hi>

                  <p>The intendment of this Quere is, to pursue the former insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of our <hi>Catechist</hi> against the Deity of Christ; as though his appointment to his <hi>Office</hi> of Mediation, were inconsistent with his <hi>Divine Nature:</hi> the vanity of which pretence hath been sufficiently already discovered. In briefe, Christ is considered either <hi>absolutely,</hi> with respect to his Divine Nature, and <hi>Person,</hi> as he is <hi>God</hi> in himselfe: and so he is a Saviour originally, of himselfe: For <hi>as for our Redeemer the Lord of Hosts is his Name, the Holy one of Israel,</hi> Isa. 47. 4. <hi>For thy Maker is thine Husband, the Lord of Hosts is his Name, the Holy one of Israel,</hi> Ch. 54. 5. In this sence was Christ a Saviour <hi>originally,</hi> and of himselfe; But as He <hi>took flesh,</hi> to accomplish the work of our Redemption, by tasting death for us, though his own mercifull and gratious Will did concurre therein, yet was he eminently <hi>designed</hi> to that work, and given by his Father, in Love, and Mercy, contriving the work of our Salvation. And this latter is mentioned not only in the places cited by our <hi>Catechist,</hi> but also in an <hi>hundred</hi> more, and not one of them lying in the least subserviency to M. B's designe.</p>

               <p>That Christ <hi>forgives sinnes,</hi> is taken for granted; And yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of Sin is the <hi>supreamest Act of</hi> Soveraigne Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that God exerciseth in the World. Now Christ may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered two waies. 1. <hi>Absolutely,</hi> as <hi>God over all,</hi> blessed for ever; So he forgave sinnes by his own Originall Authority and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as the Law-giver, who is able to save and to destroy. 2. As <hi>Mediatour,</hi> God and Man; and so his Power was delegated to him by God the Father, as himselfe speakes: <hi>All power is given unto me, in Heaven and in Earth,</hi> and <hi>Mat.</hi> 9. he saith, that he had Power <hi>on earth to forgive sinnes, i. e.</hi> given unto him. Now for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sinnes, is either <hi>Autheritative,</hi> or <hi>declarative.</hi> The latter Christ delegated to his Apostles, and all their successors in the Work of Preaching the Gospell: and it is such a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as a meer man may be invested withall. Forgivenesse of sins, which we terme <hi>Authoritative,</hi> being an act of <hi>Soveraign</hi> Divine Power, exercised about the <hi>Law,</hi> and <hi>Persons</hi> concerned therein, may be said to be given to Christ two waies. 1. As to the possession of it: And so he hath it from his Father, as God; as
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:115372:228"/> he hath his Nature, Essence, and Life from him. Whence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever workes the Father doth, He doht likewise; quicken, as he quickens; Pardon, as he Pardons; as hath been declared. 2. As to the <hi>Execusion</hi> of it, for such an end and purpose; as the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of the Work of Mediation committed to him. And so it is <hi>given him</hi> in Commission from the Father, who <hi>sent</hi> him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to do his will; and in this sence had <hi>He,</hi> the Son of Man, <hi>power to forgive sins, whilest he was in the Earth.</hi> And to M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B's Ninth Chapter this may suffice.</p>

               <p>His first Quest. is. <hi>Is not Christ dignifyed as with the title of Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, so also wiih that of Prophet.</hi> Ans. Act. 3. 20, 22.</p>
               <p>M. <hi>Biddle</hi> tels us <hi>C.</hi> 4. that <hi>Christ is dignifyed with the title of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> though he be <hi>not</hi> so; and here that he is dignifyed with the <hi>Title of a Prophet,</hi> but leaves it at large, whether he were so indeed or no. We are resolved in the case. The first promise made of him by God to <hi>Adam,</hi> was of him, generally as a <hi>Mediatour,</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as a <hi>Priest,</hi> as he was to <hi>break the Head of Sathan,</hi> by the<note place="margin">Gen. 3. 15.

                     </gap>using</hi> of his <hi>own heele.</hi> The next solemne renovation of it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> was of him as <hi>King,</hi> taking all nations to be his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. And the third by <hi>Moses</hi> after the giving of the Law, as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> to teach and instruct his redeemed people. And a <hi>Prophet</hi> he is; the great Prophet of his Church; not only <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed</hi> with that Title, but so he is indeed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But says M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> he is <hi>dignifyed with the title of a Prophet,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> as well as of <hi>Mediatour.</hi> As though his being a Prophet were contradistinguished from his being a <hi>Mediatour.</hi> Christs <hi>teaching</hi> of his people is part of the <hi>Mediation</hi> he hath undertaken. All that he doth on their part, in offering <hi>gifts</hi> and <hi>sacrifices</hi> to God
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115372:229"/> for them, all that he doth on the part of God towards them, by <hi>instructing</hi> and <hi>ruling</hi> of them, He doth, as he is the <hi>Mediatour between God and man,</hi> the <hi>surety</hi> of the Covenant. He is not then a <hi>Mediatour and a Prophet,</hi> but He who is the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> is the <hi>High Priest</hi> and <hi>Prophet</hi> of his Church. Nor are there any acts, that he exerciseth on the one, or other of these accounts, but they are all acts of <hi>his</hi> Mediation, and of <hi>him</hi> as a Mediatour. M. B. indeed tells us not, what he understands by the Mediation of Christ His Masters so describe it, as to make it all one with his Propheticall Office, and nothing else: Which makes me somewhat to wonder, why this man seemes to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them.</p>
               <p>Many more notions of M. <hi>Biddles Masters</hi> are here omitted;<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> as that Christ was not the <hi>Prophet</hi> of his People under the Old Testament, though by his Spirit he preached even to those that were <hi>disobedient in the dayes of Noahs,</hi> and it was the <hi>Spirit of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 3. 19, 20 1 Pet. 1. 11.</note>
                  <hi>Christ,</hi> that was in all the Prophets of old, whereby God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed his Church: That he is a Prophet only, because he hath<note place="margin">Isa. 61. 1. Luke 14 18▪ John 16. 7, 8, 9, 10. 1 John 5. 20.</note> given unto us a <hi>New Law;</hi> though he promise effectually to <hi>open blind eyes,</hi> and to send his <hi>Spirit to teach us,</hi> and to lead us into all truth▪ giving us understanding, that we may know him that is true. But he layes dirt enough in our way, so that we shall not need farther to rake into the dunghill.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I should not have thought that M. <hi>Biddle</hi> could have<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> taken advantage for his <hi>End and purpose</hi> from the place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture he mentions <hi>Act. 3. 20, 22.

                     </gap>theren like unto me,</hi> but that I find him in his next <hi>Querie</hi> repeating that expression [<hi>like unto me</hi>] and wresting of it to be the foundation of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit plainly <hi>jocular.</hi> Christ was <hi>like to Moses,</hi> as he was a Prophet, and like to <hi>Aaron,</hi> as he was a Priest, and like to <hi>David,</hi> as he was a <hi>King.</hi> That is, he was represented and <hi>typified,</hi> by all these, &amp; had that likenesse to them, which the <hi>Antitype</hi> (as the thing typifyed is usually, but improperly called) hath to the <hi>Type:</hi> But that therefore he must not only be <hi>like them</hi> in the <hi>Generall Office</hi> wherein the correspondency doth consist, but also in all the particular concernments of the Office, as by them administred, is to confound the Type and (the <hi>Antitype,</hi> or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) thing typifyed. Nor do the words used either by <hi>Moses,
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:115372:229"/> Deut</hi> 18. 18. or by <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 3. 22. intimate any such <hi>similitude</hi> or likenesse between Christ and <hi>Moses,</hi> as should extend to such particulars, as are afterw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>had the priviledge above other Prophets, that God made not himselfe known to him in a vision, nor spake to him in a dreame, but face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend, and shewed to him the similitude of▪ the Lord</hi> Exod. 33▪ 11. Numb. 12. 6, 7, 8. <hi>Can you tell any passage of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which intimateth, that Christ did see God before the discharge of his Propheticall Office.</hi> Ans. <hi>John 6. 45, 46.

That Christ was in all things like <hi>Moses,</hi> so that what <hi>Moses</hi> did, He must doe also▪ Therefore, 1. Christ did see the face of God, as a man: 2. He did it before he entred his <hi>Propheticall Office;</hi> whereunto adde 3. the proofe of all; <hi>no man hath seen the Father, save he which is from God:</hi> That is, Christ <hi>only</hi> saw the <hi>face</hi> of God, and no man else; when the ground of the whole <hi>fiction</hi> is, that <hi>Moses</hi> saw it before him.</p>

The <hi>ascent</hi> there mentioned, answers the discourse that our <hi>Saviour</hi> was then upon, which was to enforme <hi>Nicodemus</hi> in Heavenly things; To this end he tells him (<hi>v.</hi> 12.) that they were so slow of Believing▪ that they could not receive the plainest Doctrine, nor understand even the visible things of the Earth, as the <hi>blowing of the winde,</hi> nor the causes, and issue of it: much lesse did they understand the <hi>Heavenly</hi> things of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> which none (saith he, <hi>v.</hi> 13.) hath pierced into, is acquainted withall, <hi>hath ascended into Heaven,</hi> in the knowledge of, but he who <hi>is</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and is sent of God into the world to instruct you.

<pb n="384" facs="tcp:115372:236"/> Salvation and the Obedience he requireth of us. And so there is a <hi>Law</hi> of Faith; that is, <hi>a doctrine of Faith,</hi> opposite to the <hi>Law,</hi> as to its <hi>Covenant</hi> ends <hi>simply</hi> so called. And he also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted some peculiar significant Ceremonies, to be used in the worship of God; pressing in particular in his teaching, and by his example the duty of love, which thence is particularly called a <hi>new Commandement,</hi> and the <hi>Law of Christ,</hi> Gal. 6. 2. even that which he did so eminently practice: As he was a Teacher, a Prophet come out from God, He taught the minde, and will, and worship of God; from his own <hi>bosome</hi> Joh. 1. 18. Heb. 1. 1. And as he was, &amp; is the King of his <hi>Church,</hi> he hath given <hi>precepts</hi> and Lawes, and Ordinances, for the Rule and government thereof, to which none can adde, nor from them may detract. But take the word <hi>Law, strictly,</hi> in reference to a <hi>Covenant</hi> end, that He which performes it shall be <hi>justifyed</hi> by his performance thereof; So we may say, he gave the <hi>Law originally</hi> as God, but as Mediatour he gave no <hi>such Law,</hi> or <hi>no Law</hi> in that sence, but revealed fully and clearely our <hi>justification</hi> with God upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Account; and gave no new precepts of Obedience, but what were before given in the Law, written Originally in the heart of man by nature, and delivered to the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Wildernesse; of which in the chapter of <hi>Justification.</hi>

The Law of Faith mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. is no more but the Doctrine of the Gospell, and of Justification without the workes of the Law, that is, all workes commanded by what <hi>Law</hi> soever: as the whole doctrine of the word of God is called the Law, neere an hundred times in the <hi>Psalmes.</hi> The <hi>law of Faith</hi> is that which is opposed to the <hi>law of workes,</hi> as a meanes of obtaining Righteousnesse, which is not by obedience to <hi>new</hi> Commands.</p>

               <p>The places in <hi>Ja. 2. 12. Ja.</hi> 1. 25. speak directly of the Morall Law, which is manifest by that particular annumeration of its precepts, which we have subjoyned, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But M. <hi>Biddles</hi> Masters have a farther reach in the asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> Christ to have given a <hi>new Law:</hi> namely, whereas they place <hi>Iustification</hi> as a <hi>Consequent</hi> of our own obedience, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving how impossible it is to doe it, on the Obedience yielded to the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> the Apostle having so frequently, &amp; expressly decryed all possibility of <hi>Iustification</hi> thereby, they have therefore faigned to themselves, that Christ Jesus hath given a <hi>New Law,</hi> in Obedience whereunto we may be justifyed; which when they attempt to prove, it will be needfull for them to produce other manner of evidences, then that hereby M.

               <p>Having reckoned up the <hi>Expositions</hi> of the Law, and its <hi>vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi> given by our Saviour <hi>Math.</hi> 5. in the next <hi>Querie,</hi> he calls them very ignorantly the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>New Covenant.</hi> If M.

                  <hi>workes of the Law,</hi> and not daring to lay it upon that, which the Apostle doth expressly so often reject, they strive to relieve themselves with this; that our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath so dealt with the Law as here is expressed; so that to yeild obedience to it now as <hi>mended, perfected, and reformed,</hi> must needs be sufficient to our <hi>justification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Two things are here affirmed to be done by the Lord<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> Christ, in reference to the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> as it is called; that is, the <hi>Morall Law,</hi> as is evident by the following instances, given to make good the Assertion; first that he <hi>perfects</hi> it, secondly that he <hi>corrects</hi> it; and so a double imputation is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aid on the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:115372:237"/> Law of God. 1. Of <hi>Imperfection.</hi> 2. Of <hi>Corruption,</hi> that needed Amendment or Correction.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to examine the particular instances,<note place="margin">§. 34.</note> whereby the man attempts to make good his insinuation, the Honour of <hi>God,</hi> and his <hi>Law,</hi> requires of us, that it be vindicated from this double Calumny, and demonstrated to be neither <hi>imperfect,</hi> nor to stand in need of <hi>correction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For its perfection we have the Testimony of God himselfe expressly given thereunto, Psal. 19. 7. <hi>The Law of the Lord is</hi> PERFECT <hi>converting the Soul.</hi> It is the <hi>perfect Law of liberty,</hi> Jam. 1. 25. Yea so <hi>perfect,</hi> as that God hath forbidden any thing to be added to it, or to be taken from it <hi>Deut. 4. 1, 2. Deut.</hi> 12. 32.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Law wants <hi>Perfection,</hi> it is in respect of its <hi>essentiall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 35.</note> parts, or its <hi>integrall</hi> parts, or in respect of <hi>degrees.</hi> But for its<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note>
                  <hi>essentiall</hi> parts it is <hi>perfect,</hi> being in matter, and forme, in sence, and sentence, <hi>Divine, Holy, Just, Good.</hi> For its <hi>Integrals,</hi> it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priseth the whole <hi>Duty of man</hi> Eccles. 12. and the last; which <hi>doing</hi> he was to <hi>live;</hi> And for the <hi>degrees</hi> of its commands, It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that we <hi>love the Lord our God with all our hearts, and all our soules, and our neighbours as our selves;</hi> which our Saviour confirmes as a <hi>Rule of perfection.</hi> Math. 22. 37.</p>
               <p n="3">3. If the Law of God was not <hi>perfect,</hi> but needed <hi>correction</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 36.</note> it is either because God <hi>could not,</hi> or <hi>would not</hi> give a perfect and compleat Law: To say the first, is <hi>Blasphemy:</hi> for the latter, theres no pretence for it. God giving a Law for his Service, proclaiming his <hi>wisdome</hi> and <hi>Holinesse</hi> to be therein, and that if any man did performe it, he should live therein, certainely would not give such a Law, as by its imperfection should come short of any of the ends and purposes, for which it was appointed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>perfection</hi> of the Law is hence also evinced; that the<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> precepts of Christ wherein our obedience requires us to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, are the <hi>same,</hi> and <hi>no other</hi> then the precepts of the Law: his <hi>new commandment</hi> of love is also an <hi>old</hi> one, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 7, 8. which Christ calls his <hi>new command,</hi> Joh. 13. 34. and the like instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces might be multiplyed, neither will the instance of M. B. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the contrary which he argues from <hi>Mat</hi> 5. for that Christ doth not in that <hi>chapter correct</hi> the <hi>Law,</hi> or adde any new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:115372:237"/> thereunto, but expounds and vindicates it from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Glosse of the <hi>scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> appeares,</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the <hi>Occasion</hi> of the discourse, and the Proposition<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> which our Saviour makes good, establisheth, and confirmeth therein: which is laid down <hi>v. 21. Except your righteousnesse ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the righteousnesse of the Scribes and Pharisees, you cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi> In pursuit of this proposition. He mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festeth what their <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> was, by examining their <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chisme</hi> upon the <hi>Commandements,</hi> and the Exposition they made therein of them. It is not the Righteousnesse of the Law that our Saviour <hi>rejects,</hi> and requires more in his Disciples, but that of the <hi>Pharisees</hi> whom he every where called Hypocrites: But for the Law he tells them a <hi>Tittle of it shall not passe away,</hi> &amp; he that keepes it shall be called <hi>great,</hi> or be of great esteeme in the <hi>Kingdome of God:</hi> and the good workes; that our Saviour then required in his Disciples, are no other but those that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Law.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The very <hi>Phraseology,</hi> and manner of speech here used by<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> our Saviour, manifests of <hi>whom,</hi> and concerning <hi>what</hi> he speaks; <hi>you have</hi> HEARD <hi>that it was</hi> SAID <hi>to them of old time;</hi> you have <hi>heard,</hi> not you have <hi>read;</hi> you have <hi>heard it of the Scribes and Pharisees,</hi> out of <hi>Moses</hi> chaire they have <hi>told</hi> you, that it was thus <hi>said;</hi> and you have heard that it was SAID to them of Old; not that it was <hi>written,</hi> that it was <hi>written</hi> in <hi>the Law,</hi> the <hi>Expression</hi> whereby he citeth what wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The commands of God, revealed by Jesus Christ, are here referred to three heads. 1. The Ten <hi>Commandements</hi> given by <hi>Moses:</hi> for so that part is explained in the next Question, where they are said to be the Decalogue. 2. The additions made by Christ thereunto. 3. His own peculiar institutions.</p>
               <p>As to the first, I desire only to know how the <hi>ten Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 42.</note> were revealed by Jesus Christ. The Catechist confesseth that they were given to <hi>Moses,</hi> and revealed by that means; how are they then said to be revealed by Christ: if they shall say, that he may be said to reveale them, because he promulged them anew, with new <hi>Motives, Reasons, and Encouragements,</hi> I hope he will give us leave to say also, that what he calls a <hi>new Commandement,</hi> is not so termed in respect of the <hi>matter of it,</hi> but its new enforcement by Christ: we grant Christ revealed that Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> with its new Covenant Ends, as he was the great Prophet of his Church, by his Spirit, from the foundation of the World; but this <hi>Smalcius</hi> denyes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Christ made no new additions to the Morall Law,<note place="margin">§. 43.</note> hath been partly evidenced from what hath been spoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>perfection thereof,</hi> with the intention of our Saviour in that place, and those things wherein they say <hi>these additions</hi> are found and do consist; and shall yet farther be evinced, from the consideration of the particulars by them instanced in.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="389" facs="tcp:115372:238"/>3. It is granted, that our blessed Saviour did for the times<note place="margin">§. 44.</note> of the New Testament institute the two Ordinances of <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme</hi> and the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> in the roome of them, which toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their representation of the <hi>benefits,</hi> which Believers receive by him, did also prefigure him as to come. But 1. these are no new Law, nor part of a new Law, with a Law designe in them. 2. Though there is an <hi>obedience</hi> in their performance yeil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to God &amp; Christ, yet they belong rather to the <hi>Promise,</hi> th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n the Precepts of Christ; to our <hi>priviledge,</hi> before unto our <hi>duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the progresse of that <hi>Catechist,</hi> after some discourse about<note place="margin">§. 45.</note> the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> and <hi>Judiciall</hi> Law, with their abolition, and his allowance of Magistrates among Christians notwithstanding, (which they do, upon condition he shed no blood for any cause whatever) He attempts in particular, to shew what Christ added to the Morall Law, in the severall Precepts of it. And to the first he saies, that Christ added two things. 1. In that he prescribed us a certain forme of Prayer; of which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards in the Chapter designed to the consideration of what M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B. speaks to the same purpose. 2. That we acknowledge himselfe for God, and Worship him; of which also in our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of the <hi>Kingly Office</hi> of Christ. To the Second, he saies, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the New Testament, not only, that we should not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship <hi>Images,</hi> but avoid them also; which is so notoriously false, the avoiding of Images of our own making, being no lesse cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> then in the <hi>New,</hi> that I shall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist thereon. The residue of his <hi>plea</hi> is the same with M. B's from <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. where what they pretend shall be considered in order.</p>
               <p>To consider then briefely the particular Instances: The first<note place="margin">§. 46.</note> is in reference to the Sixth Commandement, <hi>Thou shalt not Kill.</hi> This the <hi>Pharisees</hi> so interpreted, as that if a man kept himselfe from <hi>blood,</hi> and from causing the <hi>death of ano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Our Saviour<note place="margin">See a full and cleare expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of this place by D. <hi>Lightfeet,</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</note> lets his Disciples know, that there is a <hi>closer,</hi> and nearer sence of this Law: <hi>I say unto you,</hi> in the Exposition of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, <hi>that any rash anger, anger without a cause,</hi> all offence gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, proceeding from thence, in light vilifying expressions, such as <hi>Racha,</hi> much more all provoking taunts and reproaches, as <hi>thou fool,</hi> are forbidden therein, so as to render a man ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the judgement of God, and condemnation in their

Hence then having manifested the least breach of Love and Charity towards our Brother to be a breach of the Sixth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and so to render a man <hi>obnoxious</hi> to the <hi>judgement</hi> of God, in severall degrees of sinne, according as the eruptions of it are, he proceeds in the following verses to exhort his Disciples to <hi>Patience, Forbearance,</hi> and <hi>Brotherly Love,</hi> with readinesse to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement and Forgivenesse, verses 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In the next place, he proceeds to the vindication, and<note place="margin">§. 47.</note> Exposition of the <hi>Seventh Commandement,</hi> v. 27. <hi>Thou shalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery:</hi> which the <hi>Pharisees</hi> had so expounded, as that if a man kept himselfe from <hi>Actuall uncleannesse,</hi> however he lived <hi>loosely,</hi> and put away <hi>his Wife at his Pleasure,</hi> he was free from the breach thereof. To give them the true meaning, and Sence of this <hi>Commandement,</hi> and farther to discover the <hi>hypocrisy</hi> of the <hi>Pharisees,</hi> he lets them know;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Concupiscence</hi> of the Heart, and inordinate desire of any Person, is the <hi>Adultery</hi> here no lesse forbidden, then that of <hi>actuall uncleannesse,</hi> which the Law made death.

If a man sweare by the <hi>Temple,</hi> it is nothing; he is not bound by his Oath; but if he sweare by the <hi>Gold</hi> of the Temple, he is obliged.

               <p n="4">4.

To root out the rancour and malice of the minds of Men, which by this means were nourished, and fomented in them, our Saviour lets them know, that notwithstanding that proceedure of the Magistrate by the Law, yet indeed all <hi>private revenges</hi> were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, and <hi>all readinesse</hi> to contend with others: which he am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifieth in the proposall of some particular cases; and all this by vertue of a Rule, which himselfe affirmes to be contained in the Law; <hi>Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy selfe,</hi> v. 38, 39, 40, 41, 42. pressing also <hi>lending,</hi> and <hi>giving,</hi> as works of charity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto a blessing is so often pronounced in the Old Testament.</p>

This the wretched <hi>Hypocrites</hi> laid hold of, to make up a Rule, and Law for private men to walke by, in reference to them, whom they accounted their Enemies, in expresse contradiction to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of God, <hi>Ex. 23. 4, 5.

So that in none of the instances mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is there the least evidence of what was proposed to be confirmed by them, namely, that our Saviour <hi>gave a new Law,</hi> in that he did <hi>partly perfect,</hi> partly <hi>correct</hi> the Law of <hi>Moses;</hi> seeing he did only vindicate the <hi>sence</hi> and <hi>meaning</hi> of the Law, in <hi>sundry precepts</hi> thereof, from the false Glosses and Traditions of the Scribes and Pharisees, invented and imposed on their Disciples, to be a cloak to their <hi>hypocrisy</hi> and wickednesse.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>You have made it appeare plainly that the Law of Faith, or the New Covenant, whereof Christ was the Mediator, is better then the Law of Workes, or the Old Covenant, whereof Moses was the Mediator in respect of Precepts, is it also better in respect of Promises?

               <p>This is indeed a <hi>comfortable</hi> passage, for the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing whereof I shall <hi>single</hi> out the severall noble Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are insinuated therein, and evidently contained in the words of it: as</p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ was the Mediator of the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> the new<note place="margin">§. 52.</note> Law, in the same sence as <hi>Moses</hi> was Mediator of the <hi>Old Law,</hi> the Law of Workes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Christs Addition of Precepts and Promises to the <hi>Law of Moses,</hi> is the <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> or the <hi>New Covenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The People, or the Church of the Jewes, lived under the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> or the Law of Workes: whereof <hi>Moses,</hi> not Christ was the Mediator▪</p>
               <p n="4">4. The difference betweenthe <hi>Old,</hi> and the <hi>New Covenant,</hi>
                  <pb n="393" facs="tcp:115372:240"/> lyes in this; that the New hath more <hi>Precepts</hi> of Obedience, and more <hi>Promises</hi> then the Old.</p>
               <p>And now truly he that thinks, that this man understands<note place="margin">§. 53.</note> either the <hi>Old Covenant,</hi> or the <hi>New,</hi> either <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>Christ,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Faith,</hi> or <hi>Workes,</hi> shall have liberty from me to enjoy his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, for I have not more to adde, to convince him of his mistake, then what the man himselfe hath here deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>For my part, I have much other <hi>work</hi> to do, occasioned by M. B. and therefore I shall not here divert to the consideration of the <hi>two Covenants,</hi> and their <hi>difference,</hi> with the <hi>twofold Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, both before, and after Christs coming in the flesh; but I shall content my selfe with some briefe Animadversions upon the forementioned Propositions, and proceed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In what sence Christ is the <hi>Mediatour of the new Covenant,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 54.</note> I shall (God assisting) at large declare, when I come to treat of his death, and satisfaction; and shall not here prevent my selfe in any thing of what must then, and there, be delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That there are precepts, and Promises attending the new Covenant, is granted; but that it consists in any addition of precepts to the <hi>Mosaicall</hi> Law, carryed on in the same tenour with it, with other promises, is a figment directly destructive of the whole Gospell, and the mediation of the Sonne of God. By this meanes the whole undertaking of Jesus Christ, to lay downe his Life a Ransome for us, our justification by his blood, his being <hi>of God made Righteousnesse to us,</hi> the free pardon of our sinnes, and Acceptation with God, by, and for him, as he is the end of the Law for righteousnesse, all communication of effectuall grace, to worke in us new Obedience, the giving of a new <hi>cleane heart,</hi> wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>h the Law of God written in it by the Spirit, in a word, the whole promise made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> the whole <hi>new Covenant,</hi> is excluded from the Covenant, and men left yet in their sinnes. The Covenant of workes was, <hi>doe this and live,</hi> and the tenour of the Law, <hi>if a man do the things thereof, he shall live thereby;</hi> that is, if a man by his own strength per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme, and fulfill the Righteousnesse that the Law requires, he shall have Eternall Life thereby.

                  <hi>insufficient</hi> as to any such end and purpose; what then doth God substitute in roome thereof: why a <hi>new Covenant,</hi> that hath more precepts added to the old, with all those of the Old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, that respected Morall Obedience. But is this a remedy? Is not this rather a new burthen? If the Law could not save us before, because it was impossible through sinne that we should perfectly accomplish it, and therefore by the <hi>deeds of the Law shall no man be justifyed:</hi> Is it a likely way to relieve us, by making an addition of more <hi>precepts</hi> to them, which before we could not observe? But that through the Righteous hand of God, the interest of mens immortall soules is come to be concerned therein; I should think the time exceedingly lavish't, that is spent in this Discourse. Let him that is ignorant, be ignorant still, were a sufficient answer. And this that hath been said, may suffice to the fourth particular also.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>Moses</hi> was a Mediator of a <hi>Covenant of workes,</hi> properly▪<note place="margin">§. 55.</note> &amp; formally so called, &amp; that the <hi>Church</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> lived under a Covenant of workes, is a no lesse pernitious figment then the former. The Covenant of workes was, <hi>do this and live;</hi> on perfect obedience you shall have life. Mercy, and pardon of sinnes were utter strangers to that Covenant, and therefore by it the Holy Ghost tells us, that no <hi>man could be Saved.</hi> The Church of old had the <hi>Promises of Christ,</hi> Rom. 9. 5. Gen. 3. 15. Chap. 12. 3. were <hi>justifyed by Faith,</hi> Gen 15. 6. Rom. 4. Gal 3. obtained Mercy for their sinnes, and were <hi>justifyed in the Lord,</hi> Isa. 42. 24. had the <hi>Spirit for conversion, Regeneration, and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> Ezek. 11. 19. Chap. 36. 26. expected, and obtained Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> things as remote from the <hi>Covenant of Workes</hi> as the <hi>East</hi> from the <hi>West.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, the <hi>Administration</hi> of the Covenant of Grace, which they lived under, was <hi>darke, legall,</hi> and <hi>low,</hi> in comparison of that, which we now are admitted unto, since the comming of Christ in the flesh; but the covenant wherein they walked with God, and that wherein we find acceptance, is the same; and the Justification of <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father, the patterne of<note place="margin">Rom. 4. 4, 5.</note> ours.</p>
               <p>Let us now see what answer▪ M. B. Applyes to his Querie:<note place="margin">§. 56.</note>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:115372:241"/> The first text he mentions is, Heb. 8. 6. <hi>But now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministry, by how much also he is the Mediatour of a better Covenant, built upon better promises.</hi> That which the Holy Ghost here affirmes, is, that the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> whereof Christ is the Mediatour, is <hi>better then</hi> the <hi>Old;</hi> and that it hath better <hi>Promises:</hi> which I suppose none ever doubted. The Covenant is <hi>better,</hi> seeing that could by no meanes save us, which by this Christ doth to the uttermost. The <hi>promises</hi> are better, for it hath innumerable promises of <hi>Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>version, Pardon,</hi> and <hi>Perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> which that had not at all; and the promise of Eternall life, which that had, is given upon infinitely better, and surer, termes. But all this is nothing at all to M. B's purpose.</p>
               <p>No more is the second place which he mentioneth, Heb. 7.<note place="margin">§. 57.</note> 19. <hi>The Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not that by the <hi>Law,</hi> in that place, the <hi>Covenant of workes</hi> is intended, but the <hi>legall Administration</hi> of the Covenant of Grace. This saith the Apostle, <hi>made nothing perfect;</hi> men were kept under <hi>Types,</hi> and <hi>Shaddowes,</hi> and though they were Children of God by Adoption, yet in comparison, they were kept as <hi>servants,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under Age untill the fullnes of time came, when the <hi>bringing in of Jesus Christ, that better hope,</hi> made the Administration of<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> Grace perfect, and compleat. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B. all along <hi>obscures</hi> himselfe under the ambiguous terme of the <hi>Law;</hi> confounding its <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> &amp; <hi>subsequent</hi> use; For the <hi>Covenant use</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> or as it was the tenour of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of workes, the Saints of the Old Testament were no more concerned in it, then are we. The Subsequent use of it, may be considered two waies. 1. As it is <hi>purely Morall,</hi> exacting perfect Obedience, and so the use of it is common to them and us. 2. As attended with <hi>ceremoniall and judiciall</hi> institutions in the Administration of it, and so it was peculiar to them: And this one observation will lead the Reader through much of the Sophistry of this Chapter, whose next Question is.</p>
               <p>

               <p n="1">1. There are <hi>innumerable</hi> promises of <hi>Life</hi> and immortallity<note place="margin">§. 59.</note> in the Old Testament, given to the Church under the Law.

               <p>As for his Exaltation at his Ascension, it was not by any<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> investiture in any new Office, but by an Admission to the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of that part of his work of Mediatorship which did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, in a full and glorious manner; the whole concernment of his humiliation being past; In the mean time doubtlesse he<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 8.</note> was a King, when the Lord of Glory was crucifyed.</p>
               <p>But that which remaines of this Chap. is more fully to be<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> considered.</p>
               <p>Question 4. is. <hi>How ought men to Honour the Sonne of God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence to the end of the Chap. M. B. insists on the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worship,</hi> and invocation of Jesus Christ: which with all his Companions, he places as the consequent of his <hi>Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and that <hi>Authority,</hi> wherewith for the execution and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge thereof from God he is invested. I shall very briefly consider what is tendered by M. B. to the purpose in hand, and then <hi>take liberty</hi> a little more largely to handle the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse of the <hi>Worship</hi> of Jesus Christ, with the Grounds, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and Motives thereof.</p>
               <p>His Fifth <hi>Question</hi> to this matter is, <hi>How ought men to Honour</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
                  <hi>the Sonne of God, Christ Jesus.</hi>

               <p>And it is Answered <hi>Joh. 5. 23. Even as they honour the Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is consented unto on both sides; that Jesus Christ is to be <hi>Worshipped,</hi> and <hi>Honoured</hi> with the <hi>same Worship,</hi> and <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>

How <hi>Socinus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doubled in this businesse, and was intangled, shall be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards discovered.

               <p>His next Question discovering the danger of the <hi>non perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 7.</note> of this duty, of yeilding <hi>Divine Honour and Worship</hi> to Christ, strengthens the former Assertion, and therefore I have
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:115372:244"/> nothing to except, or adde thereunto.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Question</hi> the Sixth M. B. labours to defend▪ the <hi>throat</hi> of his<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> Cause, against the edge of that Weapon, which is sharpned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it by this concession, That Jesus Christ is to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shiped with <hi>Divine Worship, as the Father is,</hi> by a diversion of it; with a consideration of the grounds of the Assignation of this <hi>Worship</hi> to Christ. His words are; <hi>Ought men to Honour the Son, as they Honour the Father, because he hath the same Essence with the Father, or because he hath the same judiciary power, what is the decision of the Son himselfe concerning this point?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Joh. 5. 22, 23▪</p>
               <p>The summe is: The <hi>same Worship</hi> is to be given to the <hi>Father</hi> and the <hi>Son,</hi> but upon severall grounds; To the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>He is God</hi> by Nature, because of his Divine Essence: to the <hi>Son,</hi> because of a <hi>Delegated judiciary Power</hi> committed to him by the Father. For the discovery of the vanity of this Assertion, in the close of our Consideration of this matter, I shall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there neither <hi>is,</hi> nor <hi>can</hi> be, any more then one <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> cause of the Attribution of the <hi>same Divine Worship</hi> to any; so that to whomsoever it is ascribed, it is upon <hi>one</hi> and the same individuall account, as to the <hi>formall,</hi> and fundamentall cause thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That no <hi>delegated Power of Judgement is,</hi> or <hi>can</hi> be a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> ground, or cause of yielding that Worship and Honour to him, to whom it is delegated, which is <hi>proper</hi> to God. For the present, to the <hi>Text</hi> pleaded, (<hi>the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgement unto the Son, that all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father.</hi>) I say in brief, that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is not expressive of the <hi>formall</hi> cause of the honouring, and Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Christ, but of an <hi>effectuall motive</hi> to men to honour <hi>him,</hi> to whom upon the account of his <hi>divine Nature</hi> that honour is due. As in the First Commandement, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the House of Bondage, thou shalt have no other Gods but me.</hi> That Expression, <hi>That brought thee out of the Land of Egypt,</hi> is a <hi>motive</hi> to the Worship of God, but not the <hi>formall</hi> cause of it: that being due to him, as he is by Nature God, blessed for ever, though he had never brought that <hi>People</hi> out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> but of this more afterwrd.</p>
               <pb n="401" facs="tcp:115372:244"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> 7. A farther diversion from the matter in hand is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> by this inquiry. <hi>Did the Father give judiciary power to the Son, because he had in him the Divine Nature, personally united to the Humane, or because he was the Son of Man: what is the decision of the Son himselfe concerning this point also?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. <hi>He hath given him authority to execute judgement, because he is the Son of Man,</hi> Ioh. 5. 27.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A point in difference is <hi>stated,</hi> and its decision enquired after, wherein there is no such difference at all. Nor do we say, that God gave Christ the <hi>judiciary Power,</hi> wherewith as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour he is invested, because he had in him <hi>the Divine Nature perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to his Humane.</hi> The Power that Christ hath upon the account of his Divine Nature, is not <hi>delegated,</hi> but <hi>essentiall</hi> to him: nor can M. B. name any, that have so <hi>stated</hi> the difference as he here proposes it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We say not that Christ <hi>had in him the Divine Nature perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to the Humane;</hi> but that the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> was Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united to the <hi>Divine.</hi> His <hi>Personality</hi> belonging to him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of his <hi>Divine nature,</hi> not his <hi>Humane.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. We grant, that the <hi>judiciary power,</hi> that was delegated to Christ, as Mediator, he being appointed of God to judge the World; was given him because <hi>he is the Son of Man,</hi> or was <hi>made Man</hi> to be our Mediator; and to accomplish the great work of the Salvation of Man-kind. But that Divine Worship, proper to God the Father, is due, and to be yielded, and ascribed to him on this ground and Reason, <hi>because he is the Son of Man,</hi> M. B. cannot prove, nor doth attempt it.</p>
               <p>The 8, 9, 10. Quest▪ belong not to us: we grant it was, and<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> is, the Will and Command of God, that lesus Christ the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator should be <hi>worshiped</hi> of <hi>Angells</hi> and <hi>Men;</hi> and that he was so Worshiped even in this World; for when he <hi>brought his first begotten into the World,</hi> he said, <hi>let all the Angels of God worship him;</hi> and that he is also to be worshipped now, having finished his<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 6.</note> work, being <hi>exalted on the Right hand of God;</hi> but that the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, foundation, and sole <hi>formall</hi> cause of the Worship, which God so commands to be yeilded to him, is any thing but his being <hi>God blessed for evermore,</hi> or his being the only begotten Son of God, there is not in the places mentioned the least intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <pb n="402" facs="tcp:115372:245"/>
               <p>The 11, 12. look againe the same way with the former, but<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> with the same successe. Saith he, <hi>When men ascribe Glory and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to Jesus Christ in the Scripture, and withall intimate the ground thereof, is it because they conceive him to be very God, and to have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally begotten out of the Divine Essence, or because he gave himselfe to death: let me heare how they explaine themselves?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> Rev. 5. 6.</p>
               <p>Q. 12. <hi>Are the Angels of the same Opinion with the Saints▪ when they also ascribe Glory and Dominion to him, let me heare how they also explain themselves?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans:</hi> Rev. 5. 11, 12: Of both these places afterward.</p>
               <p>At present 1. Christ <hi>as a Lamb,</hi> is Christ as Mediator, both God and Man, to whom all Honour and Glory is due.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Neither <hi>Saints,</hi> nor <hi>Angels,</hi> do give, or intend to give the Reason why Christ is to be worshiped, or what is the <hi>formall Reason</hi> why Divine worship is ascribed to him, but only what is in their thoughts and considerations a powerfull, and <hi>effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all motive</hi> to Love, Feare, Worship, &amp; to ascribe all glory to him. As <hi>David</hi> often cries, <hi>praise the Lord O my Soule</hi> (or assignes glory and Honour to him) because <hi>he hath done such or such things;</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating a <hi>motive</hi> to his Worship, and not the <hi>prime</hi> foundation and cause, why he is to be Worshiped.</p>
               <p>Having spoken thus to the Adoration of Christ, his last <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> is about his <hi>Invocation,</hi> which he proves from sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, not inquiring into the Reasons of it; so that adding that to the former Concession of the Worship and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour due to him, I shall close these considerations with this one <hi>Syllogisme. He who is to be Worshiped by Angels and Men with that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine worship, which is due to God the Father, &amp; to be prayed unto, called on, believed in, is God by nature, blessed for ever:</hi> but according to the confession of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B. Jesus Christ is to be <hi>worshipped by Angells and Men with that Divine worship, which is due even to God the Father, and to be prayed unto: Therefore is he God by Nature over all, blessed for ever.</hi> The inference of the <hi>major</hi> Proposition I shall farther confirme in the ensuing Considerations of the Worship, that is ascribed to Jesus Christ in the Scripture.</p>
               <p>In the endeavour of <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> to set up a new Religion,<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> there was not any thing wherein he was more opposed, or wherewith he was more exercised, by the men of the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:115372:245"/> with himselfe, then in this, about the <hi>Worship</hi> and <hi>Invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of Iesus Christ. He and his Unkle <hi>Laelius,</hi> urging (amongst others) this Proposition, <hi>that Christ was not God, Franciscus Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Budnaeus, Christianus Franken, Paleologus,</hi> with others, made the conclusion, that he was not to be worshiped as God, nor called upon. With some of these he had sundry Disputes and conferences, and was miserably intricated by them, being una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to defend his opinion, upon his <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of the Person of Christ. That Christ is to be <hi>worshiped,</hi> and <hi>Invocated,</hi> indeed he proves well and Learnedly, as in many places, so especially in his third Epistle to <hi>Mathias Radecius:</hi> But coming to <hi>knit</hi> his Arguments to his other opinion concerning Christ, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually gravelled, as more especially it befell him in his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spute with <hi>Christianus Franken An.</hi> 1584. as is evident in what is extant of that Dispute, written by <hi>Socinus</hi> himselfe. Of the chiefe argument insisted on by <hi>Franken,</hi> I shall speak after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: see <hi>Disput, cum Franken,</hi> p. 24, 25, 28, 35, &amp;c.

               <p>Revel. 19. 20. and Chap. 22. 9. do adde the command of<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> God to the generall Reason insisted on in the places before mentioned; <hi>I fell at his feet to worship him; and he said, see thou do it not, for I am thy fellow servant, and thy bretheren, that have the Testimony of Jesus, worship God,</hi> so againe, Chap. 22. 9. There are evidently two Reasons assigned by the <hi>Angell,</hi> why <hi>John</hi> ought not to worship him. 1. Because he was a <hi>servant,</hi> He that is a <hi>servant</hi> of God, and is no more, is not to be worshiped; Now he that is not God, at his best estate, however exalted, is but a <hi>servant</hi>

It is the <hi>word</hi> of the Law, that our Saviour himselfe insists on, Mat. 4. 10. that is here repeated; and the force of the Angells Reason, for the strengthning <hi>his</hi> prohibition, is from hence, that <hi>no other</hi> but he who is God, that God intended by the Law, and by our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>Math.</hi> 4. is to be worshipped. For if the intendment of the words were only <hi>Positive,</hi> that God is to be worshipped, and did not also at the same time exclude every one whatever from all <hi>divine worship,</hi> who is not that God, they would be of no force for the reproofe of <hi>John,</hi> in his attempt to worship the <hi>Angels,</hi> nor have any influence into his prohibition.

                  <hi>that all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father.</hi> That Christ should be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be worshiped in the First Commandement, (or by an addition made thereto) which commands us to have only one God, and not be worshiped with the worship which is due to that one God, is one of the <hi>mysteries</hi> of these mens Religion: but to proceed.</p>
               <p>Where the <hi>formall cause</hi> of Divine Worship is not, there Divine<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> Worship ought not to be exhibited. But in no Creature there is, or can be the <hi>formal cause▪</hi> of Divine Worship; therefore no creature, who is only such, can be worshiped without Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The <hi>formal Reason</hi> of any thing is but one; the reason of all worship is <hi>Excellency or Preheminence;</hi> The reason of <hi>Divine</hi> or Religious worship is divine <hi>preheminence</hi> and excellency. Now divine Excellency and preheminence is peculiar unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature. Wherein is it that God is so infinitely excellent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all creatures? Is it not from his infinitely good, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehensible
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:115372:251"/> nature? Now look what difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Essence</hi> of the <hi>Creator</hi> and the <hi>Creature,</hi> the same is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their Excellency. Let a Creature be exalted to never so great an height of Dignity and Excellency, yet his dignity is not at all <hi>nigher</hi> to the dignity and excellency of God; because there is no <hi>proportion</hi> between that which is <hi>infinite,</hi> and that which is <hi>finite,</hi> and limited. If then Excellency and prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence be the cause of worship, and the distance between the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of God, and that of the most excellent, and most highly advanced creature, be infinite, it is impossible that the respect and worship due to them, should be of the same kind. Now it is <hi>Religious,</hi> or Divine Adoration that is due to God, whereof the Excellency of his nature is the <hi>formall</hi> cause; this then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ascribed to any other. And to whomsoever it is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, thereby do we acknowledge to be in him all divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; which if he be not God by Nature, is grosse Idolatry. In summe▪ <hi>Adorability</hi> (if I may so say) is an absolute incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable property of God. <hi>Adoration</hi> thence arising, a respect that relates to him only.</p>
               <p>I shall for a close of this Chapter proceed to manifest, that<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> Christ himselfe is not by us <hi>worshiped,</hi> under any other <hi>formall Reason,</hi> but as he is God; which will adde some light to what hath already been spoken.

Now what excellency or dignity soever is communicated by a way of delegation, is distinct, and of another kind▪ from that which is originall, infinite, and communicating: and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the <hi>formall cause</hi> of the same honour and worship.</p>
               <p>I shall briefely give the reasons of the Assertion insisted on▪<note place="margin">§. 45.</note> and so passe on to what remaines.</p>
               <p>The first is taken from the nature of divine, or religious worship. It is that whereby we ascribe the Honour, and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all infinite perfections, to him, whom we so worship; To be the <hi>first</hi> Cause, the fountaine of all good, <hi>independent, infinitely wise, powerfull, alsufficient, almighty, alseeing, omnipotent, eternall,</hi> the only rewarder, as such we submit our selves to him religiously, in Faith, Love, Obedience, Adoration, and Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. But now we cannot ascribe these divine Excellencys, &amp; perfections unto Christ, as <hi>Mediatour:</hi> for then his <hi>Mediation</hi> should be the reason why <hi>he</hi> is all this; which it is not: but it is from
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:115372:254"/> his divine nature alone, that so he is; and therefore thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is it that he is so worshiped.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Christ under this <hi>formall conception</hi> (as they speake,) <hi>as</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 46.</note>
                  <hi>Mediatour,</hi> is not God; but under this, as <hi>partaker</hi> of the nature of God. Christ as <hi>mediatour</hi> is an expression, as they speake, in the <hi>concreté,</hi> whose <hi>form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> is its <hi>abstract.</hi> Now that is his <hi>mediation</hi> or <hi>Mediatory Office;</hi> and therefore if Christ under this <hi>formall conception</hi> of a Mediator be God, his Mediatory office, and God, must be the same: which is false and absurd. Therefore as such, or on that fundamentall account, he is not worshi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with divine worship.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Christ in respect of his mediation dependeth on God,<note place="margin">§. 47.</note> and hath all his power committed to him from God, Math. 11. 27. <hi>All things</hi> (saith he) <hi>are given me of my Father.</hi> And Math. 28. 18. <hi>All power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> Joh. 17. 2. <hi>Thou hast given unto him power over all flesh;</hi> and in innumerable other places is the same testifyed. God gives him as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour his <hi>Name,</hi> that is, his Authority. Now God is worshiped because he is <hi>independent,</hi> he <hi>is,</hi> and there is none besides him. He is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the <hi>first</hi> and the <hi>last;</hi> And if the reason why we worship God with divine worship be, because he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and independent: certainely that wherein Christ is dependent, and in subordination to him, as receiving it from him, cannot be the <hi>formall cause</hi> of attributing divine worship to him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Christ in respect of his <hi>divine nature</hi> is equall with God,<note place="margin">§. 48.</note> that is, the Father: 2 <hi>Phil.</hi> 9, 10. but in respect of his <hi>Mediation,</hi> he is not equall to him, he is <hi>lesse</hi> then he: my Father (saith he) is greater then I. <hi>John</hi> 14. 28. now whatever is <hi>lesse</hi> then God, is not equall to him, is infinitely so; for between <hi>God,</hi> and that which is <hi>not God,</hi> there is no proportion neither in <hi>Being,</hi> nor Excellency. That Christ in respect of his Office is not equall to God is commonly received in that <hi>axiome,</hi> whereby the arguments thence taken against his Deity are answered; <hi>inae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitas Officii non tollit aequalitatem naturae.</hi> Now certainely, that which is infinitely unequall to God, cannot be the <hi>formall cause</hi> of that worship which we yeild to him, <hi>as</hi> God.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That which shall cease, and is not <hi>absolutely Eternall,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 49.</note> cannot be the <hi>formall cause</hi> of our worship: for the <hi>formall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> of worship can no more cease, then God can cease to be
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:115372:254"/> God: for when that ceaseth, we cease to worship him; which whiles he is the Creator, and soveraigne Lord of his Creatures, cannot be. Now that the <hi>Mediatory Office</hi> of Christ shall cease the Holy Ghost affirmeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24. he then gives up his Kingdome to God; and there is the same Reason of the other parts of his Mediatory office. It is true indeed, the Efficacy of his Office abideth to Eternity, whilest the <hi>Redeemed ones</hi> live with God, and praise him; but as to the administration of his Office, that ceaseth, when at the last day the whole worke of it shall be perfectly consummated, &amp; he hath <hi>saved to the uttermost</hi> all that come to God by him.</p>
               <p>The sum of all is, Jesus Christ, God &amp; man, our Mediatour,<note place="margin">§. 50.</note> who is to be <hi>worshiped</hi> in all things, &amp; <hi>invocated</hi> as the Father, &amp; whom we ought night and day to honour▪ praise, love, and adore, because of his mediation, and the office of it, which for our sakes he hath undertaken, is so to be <hi>honoured and worshiped▪</hi> Not as Mediatour, exalted of God, and intrusted with all power and dignity from him, but as being <hi>equall with him, God</hi> to be bessed for ever; his divine nature being the <hi>fundamentall formall reason</hi> of that worship, and proper ultimate object of it. And to close up this digression, there is not any thing that more sharply and severely cuts the throat of the whole sophisticall plea of the <hi>Socinians,</hi> against the Deity of Christ, then this one observation. Themselves acknowedge, that Christ is to be worshiped with religious worship, and his name to be invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, denying to account them Christians, whatever they are, who are otherwise minded, as <hi>Franciscus David,</hi> and those before mentioned were. Now if there be no possible reason to be assigned for the <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ormall cause</hi> of this worship, but his Deity, they must either acknowledge <hi>him</hi> to be <hi>God,</hi> or deny <hi>themselves</hi> to be <hi>Christians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some directions (by the way) may be given from that which<note place="margin">§. 51.</note> hath been spoken, as to <hi>Guidance</hi> of our Soules in the <hi>worship</hi> of God: Or in our addresses to the <hi>Throne of Grace</hi> by Jesus Christ. What God hath discovered of <hi>himselfe</hi> unto us, he would have us act faith upon, in all that we have to deale with him in. By this we are assured we worship the true God, and not an <hi>Idol,</hi> when we worship <hi>him, who</hi> has revealed himselfe in his word, and <hi>as</hi> he has revealed himselfe. Now God hath decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:115372:255"/> himselfe to be <hi>three in one,</hi> for, <hi>there are three that beare witnesse in Heaven, &amp; these three are one,</hi> 1 Joh. 5. So then is he to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; And not only so, but the <hi>Order</hi> of the three Persons in that Deity, the eternall internall order among themselves is revealed to us. The Father is of none; is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, in respect of his <hi>Nature, Essence,</hi> and Being, not in respect of his <hi>Personality,</hi> which he hath of the <hi>Father.</hi> The <hi>Spirit</hi> is of the <hi>Father</hi> &amp; the Son. He is often so called, the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> &amp; the <hi>spirit of the Son.</hi> For the Terme of <hi>proceeding,</hi> or going forth, I professe my selfe ignorant, whether it concerne <hi>chiefely</hi> his <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall personality,</hi> or his <hi>dispensation</hi> in the worke <hi>of</hi> the Gospell. The latter I rather like, of which this is no time to give my reasons. But be those expressions of what import soever, He is <hi>equally</hi> the Spirit of the Father and the Sonne: and is of them both, and <hi>from</hi> them both. God then, by us is to be worshiped, as he hath revealed the subsistence of the three Persons in this order, and so are we to deale with him in our approaches to him.

He is <hi>sent</hi> of God, and from the love of the Father to him as Mediatour are all things given him, it <hi>pleased the Father that in him all fullnes should dwell Joh. 1. 16. Col. 23. Joh. 5. 26. He hath given him to have life:</hi> that is, as he is Mediator, appointed him to be the fountaine of <hi>Spirituall life</hi> to his elect
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:115372:255"/> and <hi>Revel▪</hi> 1. 1. the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the will of God is <hi>given</hi> unto Christ by the <hi>Father,</hi> as to this end of discovering it to the Church.</p>
               <p>Hence ariseth the second way of faiths acting it selfe toward<note place="margin">§. 54.</note> God in our worship of him. It <hi>eyes</hi> the <hi>Father</hi> as the fountaine of this dispensation; and the <hi>Sonne</hi> as the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> as the store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house, &amp; the Spirit as immediate communicator thereof. Here also it considers the Sonne under those two distinct notions. 1. As the <hi>Ordinance and servant of the Father,</hi> in the great worke of Mediation: so it loves him, delights in him, and rejoyceth in the Wisedome of God, in finding out, and giving such a meanes of Life, Salvation, and union with himselfe; and so <hi>by</hi> Christ believes <hi>in</hi> God, even the Father. It considers him 2ly as the <hi>way</hi> of going to the Father, and there it rests, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ultimate object of all the Religious actings of the soule. So we are very often said, <hi>through,</hi> and by <hi>Christ,</hi> to believe in God, <hi>by him</hi> to have an <hi>accesse</hi> to God, and an entrance to the throne of grace. In this sence, I say, when we <hi>draw nigh</hi> to God, in any religious worship yea in all the first actings, and movings of our soules towards him in faith, and love, the Lord Christ is considered as Mediator, as clothed with his offices, as doing the <hi>will of the Father,</hi> as serving the designe of his Love: and so the soule is immediatly fixed on God, through Christ, being strengthned, supported, and sustained by the consideration of Christ, as the only <hi>procuring cause</hi> of all the good things we seeke from God, and of our interest in those <hi>excellencyes,</hi> which are in him, which make him excellent to us.</p>
               <p>And this is the generall consideration that faith hath of<note place="margin">§. 55.</note> Christ, in all our dealings with God; we <hi>aske in his name,</hi> for <hi>his sake,</hi> goe to God on <hi>his</hi> account, <hi>through him,</hi> and the like; are strengthned and imboldned upon the interest of him as our High Priest, and intercessor, God the Father being yet alwayes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mediately in our eye, as the primary object of our worship. But yet now againe, this Christ, as Mediatour, so sent &amp; intrusted by the Father, as above, is also <hi>one</hi> with the <hi>Father,</hi> God to be blessed for evermore. Faith also takes in this consideration, &amp; so he who before was the <hi>meanes of fixing</hi> our faith on God, is thereupon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the proper object of our faith himselfe: <hi>we believe in Him, invocate, call upon him, worship him,</hi> put our trust in him, and
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:115372:256"/>
                  <hi>live unto him.</hi> Over &amp; above then the distinction that the <hi>Eternall Persons</hi> have in the manner of <hi>in-being</hi> in the same Essence, which also is the object of our Faith: that distinction which they have in the <hi>Externall oeconomy,</hi> is to be considered in our Religious worship of God: and herein is Christ partly eyed as the Fathers <hi>servant,</hi> the meanes, and cause of all our communion with God, and so is the <hi>medium</hi> of our worship, not the <hi>object;</hi> partly as God and man vested with that office, and so he is the object <hi>primary,</hi> and <hi>ultimate</hi> of it also: And this may give us (I say) some <hi>assistance</hi> to order our thoughts aright towards God, and some light into that variety of expressions, which we have in Scripture, about worshiping of God in Christ: and worshiping of Christ also. So is it in respect of the Spirit.</p>
               <p>Having cleared the whole <hi>matter</hi> under consideration, it may<note place="margin">§. 56.</note> be worth the while, a little to consider the condition of our <hi>Adversaries,</hi> in reference to this businesse, wherein of all other things (as I said before) they are most intangled. Of the contests and disputes of <hi>Socinus</hi> with <hi>Franciscus David,</hi> about this businesse, I have given the Reader an account formerly, and the little successe he had therein. The man would faine have <hi>stood,</hi> when he had kicked away the <hi>ground</hi> from under his feet, but was not able. And never was he more shamefully gravel'd in any dispute, then in that which he had with <hi>Christianus Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,</hi> about this businesse, whereof I shall give the Reader a brief account.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Franken</hi> seems to have been a <hi>subtile fellow,</hi> who, denying<note place="margin">§. 57.</note> with <hi>Socinus</hi> that Christ was God, saw evidently, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to find out a foundation of yeelding Religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship or Adoration unto him.

               <p>But by the favour of this <hi>Disputant,</hi> God cannot give that<note place="margin">§. 58.</note> honour that is due unto him upon the account of his <hi>Excellency</hi> and eminency, as he is the <hi>first</hi> cause of all things, and the <hi>last</hi> end, which is the ground of divine worship, to any one, who hath not his nature; The honour due to God, cannot be given to him who is not God.

The remainder of the Chapter is spent in sundry attempts to prove, that Christ <hi>was not a Priest,</hi> whilest he was on the <hi>Earth▪</hi> as also to take off from the End of his <hi>Priest-hood,</hi> with the benefit redounding to the Church thereby.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> a man would suppose M. <hi>Biddle</hi> were faire and<note place="margin">§. 2.</note> ingenious in his <hi>Concessions,</hi> concerning the <hi>Priesthood</hi> of Jesus Christ: May we but be allowed to propose a <hi>few Questions</hi> to him, and to have Answers suggested according to the Analogy of his <hi>Faith,</hi> I suppose his acknowledgement of this Truth will be found to come exceedingly short of what may be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:115372:258"/> Let him therefore shew, whether Christ be an <hi>High Priest properly</hi> so called, or only in a <hi>Metaphoricall</hi> sence, with respect to what he doth in Heaven for us, as the <hi>High Priest</hi> of old did deale for the People in their things, when he received mercy from God? Againe, whether Christ did, or doth offer a <hi>proper</hi> Sacrifice to God? and if so; of what kind? or only that his Offering of <hi>himselfe</hi> in Heaven is <hi>Metaphorically</hi> so called? If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny shall say, that M. B. differs from his <hi>masters</hi> in these things, I must needs professe my selfe to be otherwise minded, because of his following attempt to exclude him from the investiture with, and execution of his Priestly Office in this life, and at his death; whence it inevitably follows, that he can in no wise be a <hi>proper Priest,</hi> nor have a <hi>proper Sacrifice</hi> to offer, but that both the one, and the other are <hi>Metaphoricall;</hi> and so termed in allusion to what the High Priest among the Jewes did for the <hi>People.</hi> That which I have to speake to, in this ensuing discourse, will hinder me from insisting much on the demonstration of this, that <hi>Christ was a Priest properly</hi> so called, and offered to God a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Attonement,</hi> or propitiation, <hi>properly</hi> so called, whereof all other Priests, and Sacrifices appointed of God, were but Types. Briefely therefore I shall do it.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture is so <hi>positive,</hi> that Jesus Christ in the execution<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> of His Office of His Mediation, <hi>was,</hi> and <hi>is</hi> a <hi>Priest,</hi> an <hi>High Priest,</hi> that it is amongst all that acknowledge him utterly out of Question. That he is not <hi>properly</hi> so called, but <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> and in allusion to the High Priest of the Jewes (as was said) the <hi>Socinians</hi> contend. I shall then (as I said) in the first place prove, that Christ was an High Priest <hi>properly</hi> so called; and then evince <hi>when</hi> he was so; or <hi>when</hi> he entred on that Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. This first is evident from that description, or <hi>definition</hi> of an High Priest, which the Apostle gives, <hi>Heb. 5. 1. Every High Priest taken from among men, is ordained for men, that he may offer both Gifts and Sacrifices for sin.</hi> That this is the <hi>description</hi> of an High Priest <hi>properly</hi> so called, is manifest from the Apostles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of this <hi>Office</hi> spoken of to <hi>Aaron,</hi> or his exempli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the way of entrance thereinto, from that of <hi>Aaron,</hi> v. 4. And <hi>no man taketh this Honour to himselfe, but he that is called of God, as was Aaron.</hi> That is, to be such an High Priest as <hi>Aaron</hi> was, which here he describes. One that had <hi>that honour,</hi> which
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:115372:258"/>
                     <hi>Aaron</hi> had. Now certainly <hi>Aaron</hi> was an High Priest properly and truly, if ever any one was so in the World. That Jesus Christ was <hi>such</hi> an High Priest, as is here described, yea that he is the <hi>very</hi> High Priest so described by the Holy Ghost, appears upon this twofold consideration. 1. In generall; the Apostle ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates this <hi>definition,</hi> or <hi>description</hi> of an High Priest to <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> v. 5. <hi>So also Christ glorified not himself, to be made a High Priest.</hi> Were it not that <hi>very Priesthood</hi> of which he Treats, that Christ was so <hi>called</hi> to; it were easy so to reply: true! to a <hi>proper Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> a man must be <hi>called,</hi> but that which is <hi>improper &amp; Metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> only, he may assume to himself, or obtaine it upon a more generall account, as all <hi>Believers</hi> do. But this the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, by comparing Christ in his Admission to this Office, with <hi>Aaron,</hi> who was properly so. 2. In <hi>Particular,</hi> all the parts of this <hi>description</hi> have in the Scripture a full, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Accommodation unto <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> so that he must needs be <hi>properly</hi> an High Priest, if this be the description of such an one.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He was <hi>taken from amongst men.</hi> That great <hi>Prophesy</hi> of him<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> so describes him, <hi>Deut. 18. 18.

So is it with <hi>Jesus Christ, Heb. 3. 6. Christ is as a Son over his own house, whose house are we.</hi> He is <hi>for</hi> us, and over <hi>us,</hi> in the things of the Worship, and house of God. And that he was <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for men,</hi> the Holy Ghost assures us farther, chap. 7. 26. <hi>Such an High Priest</hi> BECAME US; he was <hi>so,</hi> for us: which is the first part of the description of an High Priest, <hi>properly</hi> so called.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The prime and peculiar end of this Office, is to <hi>offer Gifts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
                     <hi>and Sacrifice for sinne.</hi> And as we shall abundantly manifest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that Christ did thus offer <hi>Gifts, and Sacrifices for sinne:</hi> so the Apostle professedly affirmes, that it was necessary he should do so, because he was an High Priest, chap. 8. 3. <hi>For eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry High Priest is ordained to offer Gifts and Sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity, that this man have somewhat also to Offer.</hi> The force of the Apostles Argument, concerning the <hi>necessity</hi> of the offering of Christ, lyes thus: Every High Priest is to offer Gifts and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; but <hi>Christ is an High Priest;</hi> therefore he must have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to Offer. Now if Christ was not a <hi>Priest properly</hi> so called, it is evident his Argument would be <hi>inconclusive;</hi> for from that which is <hi>properly</hi> so, to that which is only so <hi>Metaphorically,</hi> and as to some likenesse, and proportion, no Argument will lye: for instance; Every <hi>True man</hi> is a Rationall Creature; but he that shall thence conclude, that a <hi>Painted</hi> man is so, will find his Conclusion very feeble. What it is that Christ had to <hi>Offer,</hi> and what <hi>Sacrifice</hi> he offered, shall afterward be declared. The <hi>definition</hi> then of an High Priest <hi>properly</hi> so called, in all the parts of it, belonging unto Christ, it is necessary that the thing <hi>defined</hi> belong also unto him.</p>

The absurdity of this figment, the Learned <hi>Hooker</hi> could no otherwise defend, then by affirming, that <hi>Priest</hi> was an abbreviation of <hi>Presbyter.</hi> When both in truth, and in the intendment of them that used that terme, its sence was otherwise. But to returne. The Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> were <hi>properly</hi> Priests; why so, because they were so appoynted in the <hi>Line</hi> of the Priesthood of <hi>Levi,</hi> according to the Order of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron▪</hi> Hence I assume; Christ being called a Priest, according to the Order of a <hi>True</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Priesthood, was truly, and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly</hi> so: <hi>He was a Priest after the Order of Melchisedeck,</hi> Psal. 110. 4. which the Apostle often insists on, in the Epistle to the Hebrews. If you say, that Christ is called an High Priest, after the Order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> not <hi>properly,</hi> but by reason of some proportion, and Analogy, or by way of Allusion to him: you may as well say, that he was a Priest according to the order of <hi>Aaron;</hi> there being a great similitude between them, against which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle expresly disputes in the whole 7. chap. to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> He therefore was a <hi>reall Priest,</hi> according to a Reall and Proper Order.</p>

                  <p n="4">4. Let it be considered, that the great <hi>medium</hi> of the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall<note place="margin">§. 9.</note>

                     <q>The Sacerdotall Office of Christ is placed herein, that as by his Kingly Office he can help and relieve our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities; so by his Sacerdotall Office he will help, and actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doth so.

That is, as a King he is both <hi>able</hi> and <hi>willing</hi> to save us, as to the <hi>Application</hi> of salvation, and the meanes thereof: As a Priest, he is both <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>able</hi> to save us, as to the <hi>procuring</hi> of Salvation, and all the meanes thereof. 3.

                     <q>It is called so by a figurative manner of speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for as in the Old Covenant, the High Priest entring into the Holiest of Holies, did do those things, which pertained to the expiation of the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:115372:260"/> sins of the People: So Christ hath now entred the Heavens, that there he might appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God for us, and performe all things that belong to the expiation of our sins.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The summe of what is here insinuated, is, 1. That the <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Christ</hi> is but a <hi>figurative Sacrifice,</hi> and so consequently, that he himselfe is a <hi>figurative</hi> Priest: for as the Priest is, such is his Sacrifice: <hi>Proper,</hi> if <hi>proper; metaphoricall,</hi> if <hi>metaphoricall<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> what say our Catechists for the proof hereof? they have <hi>said</hi> it; not one word of Reason, or any one Testimony of Scripture is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to give countenance to this figment. 2. That the <hi>High Priest made attonement and expiation of sinnes,</hi> only by his <hi>entring</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the most holy place, and what he did there: which is <hi>notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously</hi> false, and contrary to very many expresse Testimonies of Scripture, <hi>Levit.</hi> 4. 3, 13, 21, 27. chap. 5. 16. chap 6. 5, 6, 7. <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. &amp;c. 3. That Christ was not an High Priest, untill he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the <hi>holy place;</hi> of which afterwards. 4. That he made not <hi>expiation of our sinnes, untill he entred heaven, and appeared in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God:</hi> Of the Truth whereof, let the Reader consult <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. If Christ be a <hi>figurative</hi> Priest, I see no reason why he is not a <hi>figurative</hi> King also; and such indeed those men seem to make him.</p>
                  <p>The second thing proposed is, that Christ <hi>was an High Priest,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> whilest he was <hi>on the the Earth;</hi> and offered a <hi>sacrifice</hi> to God. I shall here first answer what was objected by M. <hi>Biddle</hi> to the contrary, and then confirme the truth it selfe.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>say</hi> then first, that Christ was a <hi>Priest,</hi> while he was on <hi>earth,</hi> and he continueth to be so for ever; that is, untill the whole worke of <hi>mediation</hi> be accomplished.</p>

                  <p>Seeing all the proofes collected for this purpose are out of the<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> Epistle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> I shall consider them in order as they
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:115372:262"/> lye in the <hi>Epistle,</hi> and not as transposed by his Questions with whom I have to do.</p>
                  <p>The first is (in his eleventh Question.) thus insinuated; <hi>Why would God have Christ come to his Priestly Office by suffering?</hi> Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the tenour of the Doctrine before delivered, the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is, that until <hi>after</hi> his sufferings he obtained not his <hi>Priestly</hi> Office, for by them he entered upon it. The Answer is. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 10. 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. The Apostle doth not say <hi>absolutely,</hi> that it became<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> Christ to be made <hi>like us,</hi> that he might be an <hi>High Priest,</hi> but that he might be a <hi>mercifull high Priest.</hi> That is, his suffering and death were not required <hi>antecedently,</hi> that he might be a <hi>Priest,</hi> but they were required to the Excecution of that End of his Priesthood, which consists in <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Sufferance</hi> together with them, in whose <hi>stead</hi> he was a Priest. He sustained all his Afflictions, and death it selfe, not that he might be a <hi>Priest,</hi> but that being <hi>mercifull,</hi> and having experience, he might on that account be ready to succour them that <hi>are Tempted;</hi> and this the words of the last verse do evidently evince to be the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Holy Ghost: <hi>in that he suffered, being tempted.</hi> His sufferings were to this end of his <hi>Priesthood,</hi> that he should be <hi>Mercifull,</hi> able to <hi>succour</hi> them that are tempted; besides, it is plainely said, that he was an High Priest <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to make Reconciliation for the sinnes of the People. Now that Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation was made by his death and blood the Scripture in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes us, <hi>Rom. 5. 10. Whilst we were enemies, we were reconciled by the death of his Sonne. Dan.</hi> 9. 24. So that even from this place of Scripture, produced to the contrary, it is evident, that Christ <hi>was an high Priest on Earth,</hi> because he was so when he made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation, which he did in his death on the Crosse.</p>
                  <p>But yet M. <hi>Biddles</hi> candid proceedure in this businesse may<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> be remarked; with his <hi>Huckstering</hi> the word of God. He reads the words in this order: <hi>It became him to make the Captaine of their Salvation perfect through fuffering; that he might be a mercifull and Faithfull high Priest.</hi> Who would not conclude, that this is the <hi>series</hi> and <hi>tenour</hi> of the Apostles Discourse? And that Christ is said to be made perfect through <hi>sufferings,</hi> that he might be a mercifull High Priest. These words of <hi>making perfect through suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</hi>
                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:115372:262"/> are part of the 10. <hi>verse:</hi> that he might be a Mercifull High Priest, part of the 17. Between which two there inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes a Discourse of a businesse quite of another nature; namely, his being <hi>made like his Bretheren</hi> in taking on <hi>him the seed of Abraham,</hi> whereof these words, <hi>that he might be a Mercifull and Faithfull High Priest,</hi> are the immediate issue: That is, he had a body prepared him, that he might be a <hi>Priest,</hi> an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 1, 2. is insisted on to the same purpose in his third<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> Question, which is; <hi>What manner of High Priest is Christ?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ans. Heb. 8. 1, 2. <hi>We have such an High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the Heavens. A Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the Sanctuary, and of the true Tabernacle, &amp;c.</hi> I name this in the next place, because it is coincident with that of Ch. 4. 14. (insisted on by <hi>Socinus,</hi> though omitted by our Author.)</p>
                  <p>Hence it is inferred, that Christ entred the <hi>Heavens</hi> before he was an <hi>High Priest;</hi> and is an <hi>High Priest</hi> only when he is set <hi>down at the right hand of the Majesty on High.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> That Christ <hi>is</hi> an high Priest <hi>there also,</hi> we grant? that he is so there <hi>only,</hi> there is not one word in the place cited to prove. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 14. saith indeed, that <hi>our High Priest is entred into the Heavens;</hi> but it sayes not, that he was not <hi>our High Priest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he did so.</hi> As the <hi>High Priest</hi> of the <hi>Jewes</hi> entred into the <hi>Holy place,</hi> but yet he was an <hi>High Priest</hi> before, or he could not have entred into it. He is such an <hi>High Priest, who is set on the right hand of the throne of Majesty;</hi> that is, not like the <hi>typicall</hi> High Priest who dyed, and was no more; but he abides in his <hi>Office</hi> of Priesthood; not to <hi>Offer Sacrifice,</hi> for that he did once for all, but to <hi>intercede</hi> for us for ever.</p>

If the word signify the place, and not the Condition of the <hi>things,</hi> whereof they are, they may be referred to the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle,</hi> of which he speakes, and not to the <hi>High Priest. v.</hi> 2. the Apostle tells us, that he is the <hi>Minister,</hi> or <hi>Priest</hi> of the <hi>true Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle,</hi> which God made, and not man: and then <hi>v.</hi> 3. that in the other <hi>Tabernacle</hi> there were <hi>Priests that Offered dayly sacrifices:</hi> So that saith he, if this <hi>Tabernacle</hi>

                     </gap>, He should not be a <hi>Priest</hi> of it. For in the Earthly Tabernacle there were other <hi>Administrators:</hi> but to passe these interpretations,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apostle does not say, that <hi>He</hi> that is upon the<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> Earth can be <hi>no</hi> Priest, which must be our Adversaries Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if <hi>any,</hi> from this place, and thus formed, <hi>He that is upon the Earth is no Priest;</hi> Christ before his <hi>Assension was upon the Earth,</hi> therefore he was no Priest. This is not the intendment of the Apostle, for in the same verse he affirmes, that there <hi>were Priests on the Earth.</hi> This then is the utmost of his intendment; that if Christ had been only to <hi>continue</hi> on the Earth, and to have done what Priests did, or were to do upon the Earth, there was neither <hi>need</hi> of him, nor <hi>roome</hi> for him: but now is He a Priest, seeing he was not to <hi>take upon him their worke;</hi> but had an <hi>Eternall Priest-hood</hi> of his own to Administer. There is no more in this place, then there is, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 19, 23, 24. which is a cleare Assertion, that Christ had a <hi>Priesthood</hi> of his own, which was to perfect and compleat all things; being not to share with the Priests, that had all their work to do upon the <hi>Earth.</hi> And in <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14, 15. of Chap. 7. you have a full exposition of the whole matter. The summe is, Christ was <hi>none</hi> of the Priests of the <hi>Old</hi> Testament; No Priest of the Law: all their <hi>earthly</hi> things vanished, when he undertooke the Administration of <hi>Heavenly.</hi> So that neither doth this at <hi>all</hi> evince, that Christ
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:115372:263"/> was not a Priest of the order of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> even before his Assension.</p>
                  <p>To this <hi>Heb.</hi> 7. 15, 16. is urged, and those words; <hi>after the</hi>

                  <p>But is this the intendment of the Apostle? Doth he aime at any such thing? The Apostle is insisting on one of his Arguments to prove from the <hi>institution</hi> of the Priest-hood of <hi>Melchisedeck,</hi> or a Priest-hood after his Order, the excellency of the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of Christ above that of <hi>Aaron;</hi> from the manner of the institution of the <hi>one</hi> and of the other, this Argument lyes: sayes he; the Priests of the <hi>Jewes</hi> were made <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Heb. 5. 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Though the place be very improperly urged, as to an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the Question proposed; there being very many more testimonyes clearly and distinctly expressing the Immediate fruits, and benefits of the Priestly Office of Christ; yet because we grant, that by his <hi>Priesthood</hi> principally, and eminently Christ is become the Author of Salvation, we shall not <hi>dissent,</hi> as to this Question and Answer. Only we adde as to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the way whereby Christ by his Priesthood became the Author of Salvation, consists principally in the Offering up of himselfe to death, in, and by the <hi>shedding of his blood,</hi> whereby he obtained for us Eternall Redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14, 26.</p>
                  <p>But this M. B. makes enquiry after. Qu. 8. <hi>How can Christ save</hi>

                     <hi>them by his Priesthood? Ans.</hi> Heb. 7. 25. Heb. 9. 28.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. We acknowledge the use of the Intercession of Christ, for the carrying on, and the compleating of the work of our Salvation: as that <hi>also</hi> it is the Apostles designe there, to manifest his Ability to save, beyond what the <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Priests could pretend unto, which is mentioned chap. 7. 25. but, that He <hi>saves us thereby,</hi> exclusively to the Oblation he made of himselfe at his Death; or any otherwise, but as carrying on that Work, whose foundation was laid therein, (Redemption being meritoriously procured thereby) I suppose M. B. doth not think, that this place is any way usefull to prove. And that place which he <hi>subjoynes</hi> is not added at all to the Advantage of his intendment: for it is most evident, that it is of the <hi>Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of Christ by death, and the shedding of his blood, or the Sacrifice of himselfe, as v. 26. that the Apostle there speaks.</p>
                  <p>There is not any thing else, that is needfull for me to insist<note place="margin">§. 26.</note> upon in this Chapter; for though the Scripture instructs us in many other <hi>uses,</hi> that we are to make of the Doctrine of the Priesthood of Christ, then what he expresses in his last question,
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:115372:264"/> yet that being one Eminent one amonst them (especially the foundation of coming with boldnesse to the Throne of Grace, being rightly understood) I shall not need to insist farther on it.</p>
                  <p>Not to put my Selfe, or Reader to any needlesse trouble, M.<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> B. acknowledging that Christ is an High Priest, and having op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed only his investiture with the Office, whilest he was upon the Earth, and that to destroy the Attonement made by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of himselfe; having proved that he was a Priest <hi>properly</hi> so called; I shall now prove that He <hi>was an High Priest whilest he was upon Earth,</hi> and shew afterwards what he had to Offer, with the Efficacy of his Sacrifice, and the Intent thereof. First, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will speedily determine the difference, <hi>Eph. 5. 2. Christ hath loved us, and hath given himselfe for us an Offering, and a Sacrifice to God, for a sweet smelling savour.</hi> He that offereth Sacrifices and Offerings unto God, is a Priest: So the Apostle defines a <hi>Priest, Heb:</hi> 5. 1.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. In that delivery of himselfe he Sacrificed; therefore he was then a Priest.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Was it the will and purpose of God that Christ should suffer the Death of the Crosse? What saith the Apostle Peter to the Jews concerning this?</hi> Ans.

               <p>It is not unknown what difference we have, both with the <hi>Socinians</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> about the purposes and efficacious <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees,</hi> and the Infallibility of the Prescience of God: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing already hath been spoken to this purpose, in our Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course concerning the Prescience of God, as formerly in that of Perseverance. How unable M. <hi>Biddles</hi> companions are to <hi>disentangle</hi> themselves from the Evidence of that <hi>Testimony,</hi> which is given to the Truth we contend for, by these Texts which here he with so much confidence recites, hath been abundantly by others Demonstrated. I shall not here enter into the <hi>merits</hi> of that cause, nor shall I impose on M. <hi>Biddle</hi> the opinion of any other men, which he doth not expressly own; only I shall desire him to reconcile what he here speakes in his <hi>Querie,</hi> with what he before delivered concerning Gods <hi>not foreseeing our free actions, that are for to come.</hi> What God purposes shall be, and come to passe, He certainely <hi>foresees,</hi> that <hi>that</hi> will come to passe. That Christ should dy the death of the <hi>Crosse</hi> was to be brought about by the <hi>free actions</hi> of men, if any thing in the <hi>world</hi> was ever so, and accomplished in the same manner; yet that this should be done, yea so done, God purposed; and therefore without doubt foresaw that it should be accomplished, and so fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw all the <hi>free actions</hi> whereby it was accomplished. And if he <hi>foresee</hi> any one free action, why not all? There being the same Reason of one and all. But at the present let this passe. His second Question is.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Our <hi>Reconciliation to God,</hi> or the reconciliation as it<note place="margin">§. 10.</note> stands on our part, is our <hi>Conversion</hi> unto God, our deliverance from all that <hi>Enmity</hi> and opposition unto God, which is in us by nature; and this also we say is the effect, and fruit of the Death of Christ.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Our <hi>bringing unto God,</hi> mentioned 1 Pet. 3. 18. is of a<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> larger and more comprehensive signification, than that of our <hi>Reconciliation;</hi> containing the whole effect of the death of Christ, in the removall of every hinderance and the <hi>Collation</hi> of every thing necessarily required to the perfect and compleat accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of the worke of our Salvation, and so containes no lesse the Reconciliation <hi>of God</hi> to us, than <hi>ours</hi> to him; and is <hi>not</hi> proper to make up one member of the division there in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, being a generall expression of them both.</p>
               <p>Now concerning these things M. <hi>Biddle</hi> enquires, <hi>Whether</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 12.</note>
                  <hi>Christ by his death reconciled God to us, or on the contrary, us to God;</hi> So insinuating, that <hi>one</hi> of these Effects of the Death of Christ is inconsistent with the <hi>other;</hi> This seemes to be the mans aime,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To <hi>intimate,</hi> that this is the state of the <hi>difference</hi> between him and us; that we say, Christ dyed to <hi>Reconcile God to us;</hi> and he, that <hi>he</hi> dyed to <hi>Reconcile us to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That these things are <hi>contrary;</hi> so that they who say the <hi>one,</hi> must deny the <hi>other;</hi> That <hi>we</hi> who say, that Christ dyed to <hi>Reconcile God to us,</hi> must of necessity deny that he dyed, to <hi>Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God;</hi> and that he also, who saith, he dyed to <hi>Reconcile us to God,</hi> may, and must deny on that <hi>account</hi> the other effect by us ascribed to his death. But this <hi>Sophistry</hi> is so <hi>grosse,</hi> as it is not worth the while to insist upon its discovery; We say, that Christ dyed to <hi>Reconcile God to us</hi> in the sence before explained,
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:115372:268"/> and <hi>us unto God;</hi> and these things are so farre from being of <hi>any</hi> Repugnancy one to another, as to the making up of one entire end, and effect of the death of Christ, that without them both the worke of Reconciliation is by no meanes compleat.</p>
               <p>Not to prevent the full proofe and evidence hereof, which is intended, it may at present suffice, that we evince it by the light<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> of this one consideration; If in the Scripture it is expressly and frequently affirmed, that <hi>Antecedently</hi> to the consideration of the Death of Christ, and the Effects thereof, there is not only a <hi>reall Enmity</hi> on our parts against God, but also a <hi>Law Enmity</hi> on the part of God against us, and that <hi>both</hi> of these are removed by <hi>Vertue</hi> of the Death of Christ, then the <hi>Reconciliation of God to us,</hi> and our <hi>Reconciliation to God,</hi> are both of them one entire effect of the death of Christ. That there is in us by nature a <hi>reall Enmity</hi> against God▪ before it be taken away by the virtue of the death of Christ, and so we Reconciled to him, is not denyed; and if it were, it might be easily evinced from <hi>Rom. 8. 18.

               <p>For the Texts cited by M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> as making to his purpose,<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> the most, if not all of them looke, another way then he intends to use them. They will in the following Chapter come under
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:115372:269"/> full consideration. Rom. 5. 10. <hi>When we were enemies we were Reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne;</hi> is the first mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. That our <hi>being Reconciled to God,</hi> in this place doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our Conversion to him, and our deposition of the <hi>Reall enmity,</hi> that is in us against him, but our Acceptance with him, upon the account of the Attonement made in the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ, whereby he is Reconciled to us, is evident from sundry <hi>circumstances</hi> of the place. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. That which is called <hi>being reconciled by his death,</hi> in 10. is <hi>being justifyed by his blood, vers.</hi> 9. The observation of the same <hi>Antithesis</hi> in both verses makes this evident. Now to be justifyed by the <hi>blood</hi> of Christ, is not to have our <hi>enmity</hi> with God slaine and destroyed (which is our Sanctification) but our <hi>Acceptation</hi> with God upon the account of the shedding of the blood of Christ for us; which is his Reconciliation to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are thus Reconciled, when we are <hi>enemies,</hi> as in the verse insisted on; <hi>when we were enemies we were Reconciled;</hi> Now we are not Reconciled in the sence of <hi>deposing our Enmity</hi> to God (that deposition being our Sanctification) <hi>whilest we are enemies,</hi> and therefore it is the Reconciliation of God to us, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>His second also of <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2. 14, 16. speakes the same language;<note place="margin">§. 15.</note>
                  <hi>He is our peace, who hath made both one, that we might reconcile both unto God in one body, by the death of his Crosse, having slaine the enmity thereby;</hi> Setting aside the <hi>joynt designe</hi> of the Apostle to manifest the Reconciliation made of <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> by the Crosse of Christ, it is evident, the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> here meant consists in <hi>slaying</hi> the <hi>enmity</hi> mentioned, so making peace; Now what is the enmity intended? Not the <hi>Enmity</hi> that is in our hearts to God, but the <hi>Legall emnity</hi> that lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, on the part of God; as is evident from <hi>v.</hi> 15. and
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:115372:269"/> the whole designe of the place, as <hi>afterwards</hi> will appeare more fully.</p>
               <p>There is indeed 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20. mention made of Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation<note place="margin">§. 16.</note>
                  <hi>in both the sences insisted on; of us to God, v.</hi> 20. where the Apostle saith, the end of the ministry is to <hi>reconcile us to God;</hi> to prevaile with us to lay down <hi>our enmity</hi> against him, &amp; oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to him; of <hi>God to us,</hi> v. 19. <hi>God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself;</hi> which to be the import of the words is evinced from the <hi>exegeticall expression</hi> immediately following; <hi>not imputing to them their sins &amp; transgressions▪</hi> God was so reconciling the world unto himselfe in Christ, as that upon the account of what was done in Christ, He will not <hi>impute</hi> their sins to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m▪ The <hi>Legall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> he had against them, on the account whereof alone mens sinnes are imputed to them, being taken away. And this is farther cleared by the summe of his former Discourse, which the Apostle gives us <hi>v.</hi> 21. declaring how <hi>God was in Christ recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himselfe;</hi> For (saith he) <hi>he made him sin for us who knew no sinne, that we might be made the Righteousnesse of God in him;</hi> Thus he was in <hi>Christ reconciling the world to himselfe,</hi> in that he <hi>made him to be sinne,</hi> or a sacrifice for sinne, so to make an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for us, that we might be accepted before God, as Righteous on the account of Christ.</p>
               <p>Much lesse doth that of the 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. In the last place men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> speak at all to M. B's purpose: <hi>Christ hath once suffered for sinne, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God; bringing to God,</hi> is a generall expression of the Accomplishment of the whole work of our Salvation, both in the removall of all <hi>hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances,</hi> and the <hi>collation</hi> of all things necessary to the fulfilling of the work: Of this the Apostle mentions the great <hi>fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,</hi> and procuring cause, which is the <hi>suffering of Christ</hi> in our stead; the <hi>just for the unjust:</hi> Christ in our stead suffered for our sinnes, that he might <hi>bring us to God;</hi> Now this suffering of Christ in our stead, for our Sinnes, is most eminently the cause of the Reconciliation of God to us; and by the <hi>intimation thereof,</hi> of our Reconciliation to God, and so of our <hi>Manuduction</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>Thus, though it be most true, that Christ Dyed to Reconcile<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> us to God, by our conversion to him, yet all the places cited by M. <hi>Biddle</hi> to prove it, (so unhappy is he in his Quotation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The next Question I shall not insist upon; It is concerning<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> the <hi>object</hi> of the death of Christ, and the Universality thereof; The words of it are, <hi>For whom did Christ dye?</hi> The Answer is from 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 14, 15. 1 Tim. 5. 6.

               <p>He proceeds; <hi>What was the procuring cause of Christs death?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans. Rom. 4. 25. Isa. 53. 5. 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 3. The Expressions are; That <hi>Christ was delivered for our offences,</hi> that <hi>Christ died for our sinnes, and was bruised for our iniquities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That in these, and the like places, that clause for our <hi>sinnes, offences,</hi> and <hi>transgressions,</hi> is expressive of the <hi>procuring cause</hi> of the death of Christ, M. B. grants; <hi>Sinne</hi> can be no otherwise the <hi>procuring cause</hi> of the death of Christ, but as it is morally <hi>merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> thereof▪ To say <hi>our sinnes were the procuring cause of the death of Christ,</hi> is to say, that our sinnes <hi>merited</hi> the death of Christ; And whereas this can no otherwise be, but as our sinnes were imputed to him, and he was put to death for them, M. B. hath in this one Question granted the whole of what in this subject he contends against. If our sinnes were the <hi>procuring cause</hi> of the death of Christ, then the <hi>death</hi> of Christ was that <hi>punishment</hi>
                  <pb n="463" facs="tcp:115372:270"/> which was due to them; or in the Justice, or according to the tenour of the Law of God, was <hi>procur'd</hi> by them; and so conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently He in his death underwent the <hi>penalty</hi> of our Sinnes, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in our stead▪ and making thereby <hi>satisfaction</hi> for what we had done amisse: M. <hi>Biddles</hi> Masters say generally that the expression of <hi>dying for our sinnes</hi> denotes the <hi>finall</hi> cause of the death of Christ; that is, Christ intended by his death to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme the <hi>Truth,</hi> in obedience whereunto we shall receive <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse of sinnes;</hi> This grant of <hi>M.</hi> B's, that the <hi>procuring cause</hi> of the Death of Christ is hereby exprest, will perhaps appeare more Prejudiciall to his whole cause, then he is yet aware of; especially being proposed in distinction from the <hi>finall</hi> cause, or end of the Death of Christ, which in the next place he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">Crellius de Causis Mortis Christi. p. 13.</note> as afterward will more fully appeare; although I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse he is not alone; <hi>Crellius</hi> making the same concession.</p>

This was the Sacrifice offered <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>: but these saith he could not do it; the <hi>Law</hi> by them could not <hi>do it,</hi> and this he proves with two Arguments.</p>
               <p n="1">1. From the Event <hi>vers. 2, 3. For then would they not have ceased to be offered; because that the worshipper once purged, should have had no more conscience of sin? But in these Sacrifices, there was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance made againe of sinnes every yeare.</hi> The words of the second verse are to be read with an <hi>Interrogation,</hi> conclusive in the negative: <hi>would they not have ceased to have been offered?</hi> That is certainely they would; and because they did not do so, it is evident from the <hi>Event,</hi> that they could not take away sinne. In most Copys the words are, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Those that adde the <hi>negative particle</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as it is frequently used.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the nature of the thing it selfe, <hi>v. 4. For it was not possible, that the blood of Bulls and Goats should take away sinne;</hi> the Reason in these words is evident and plaine, especially that of <hi>v.</hi> 4. There is a twofold impossibility in the thing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In regard of <hi>Impetration;</hi> it was impossible they should really <hi>attone</hi> God, who was provoked. 1. The conjunction between the sinner and the Sacrificed Beast, was not such, or so neere (being onely that of possessour and possessed,) that really and beyond <hi>Representation,</hi> and <hi>Type,</hi> the blood of the one could satisfy for the sinne of the other. Much lesse secondly, was there an <hi>innate worth</hi> in the blood of any <hi>beast,</hi> though never so innocent, to attone the justice of God, that was offended at sinne: <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. 6, 7. Nor thirdly, was there any will in
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:115372:274"/> them for such an undertaking, or commutation. The Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was <hi>bound with cords to the hornes of the Altar; Christ went will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly to the sacrifice of himselfe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In regard of <hi>application.</hi> The blood of Common Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices being once shed, was a <hi>dead thing,</hi> and had no more worth nor efficacy: it could not possibly be a <hi>living way</hi> for us to come to God by; nor could it be preserved, to be <hi>sprinkled upon</hi> the conscience of the sinner.</p>
               <p>Hence doth the Apostle make it evident, in the <hi>first</hi> place,<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> that Christ was not to offer any of the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which former <hi>Priests</hi> had offered, because it was utterly impossible, that by such Sacrifices, the end of the Sacrifice which he was to offer, <hi>should</hi> be accomplished. This also he proves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because God had expresly <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>isallowed</hi> of those Sacrifices, as to that <hi>End;</hi> not only it was impossible in the <hi>nature</hi> of the thing it selfe, but also God had absolutely rejected the tender of them, as to the taking away Sinne, and bringing sinners to God. But it may be said, did not God <hi>appoint</hi> them for that end and purpose, as was spoken before; the end of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the day of <hi>expiation</hi> was (<hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 30.) to <hi>attone,</hi> and <hi>cleanse; On that day shall the Priest make an attonement for you to cleanse you.</hi> (for the Priest made an Attonement actively, by offering the Sacrifice: the Sacrifice its selfe Passively, by undergoing the penalty of Death; Christ, who was both Priest &amp; Sacrifice, did both) I answer; they were never appointed of God for to accō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish that End, by any <hi>reall</hi> worth, and efficacy of their own, but meerly to <hi>typify, prefigure,</hi> and point out <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>that;</hi> which did the <hi>Work,</hi> which they represented; and so <hi>served</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle speaks, <hi>untill the time of Reformation, Heb.</hi> 9. 10. they served the use of that people, in the <hi>under-age</hi> Condition, wherein God was pleased to keep them.</p>
               <p>But now that God rejected them as to this end and purpose, the Apostle proves by the Testimony of <hi>David,</hi> speaking of the Acceptance of Christ, <hi>Psalm. 40. 6. 7. Sacrifice and offering thou diddest not desire, mine eares hast thou opened; burnt-offering, and sin-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering hast thou not required: Then said I, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o I come, &amp;c.</hi> which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle insists on, v. 6, 7, 8, 9. There are several accounts, upon which God in Scripture is said to disregard, &amp; not to <hi>approve</hi> or <hi>accept</hi> of Sacrifices, which yet were of his own Institution. 1. In respect
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:115372:275"/> of the Hypocrisy of the offerers: That people being grown <hi>formall,</hi> and <hi>corrupt, trusted</hi> in Sacrifices, and the Worke wrought in them, and said by them, they should be justified; God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing his indignation against such Sacrificers, or the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Such</hi> Persons, rejects the <hi>things</hi> themselves wherein they trusted, that is, in reference to <hi>them</hi> that used them. This is the intention of the Holy Ghost, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 1. 12, 13. but this is not the cause of their rejection in this place of the Psalmist; for he speaketh of them who <hi>walked with God</hi> in uprightnesse, and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for his Salvation; even of himselfe and other Saints, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Context, v. 5. &amp;c. 2. <hi>Comparatively;</hi> they are rejected as to the <hi>outward Work</hi> of them, in comparison of his more <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall</hi> Worship; as <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 12, 13, 14. but neither are they here rejected on that account; nor is there mention of any <hi>opposition</hi> between the outward Worship of Sacrifice, &amp; any other more Spirituall and internall part thereof: but between <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> and the <hi>boring of the eare,</hi> or <hi>preparing of the body of Christ,</hi> as expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, v. 6.</p>
               <p>Their Rejection then here mentioned, is, in reference to that<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> which is asserted, in opposition to them, and in reference to the end, for which that is asserted: look to what end Christ had a <hi>Body</hi> fitted and prepared for, and to that end, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing of it, are all Sacrifices <hi>rejected</hi> of God: now this was to <hi>take away</hi> sinne, so that as to that end are they rejected.</p>
               <p>And here in our passage may we remove what the <hi>Racovian</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> Catechisme gives us, as the difference between the <hi>expiation</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Old</hi> Testament, and that under the <hi>New,</hi> concerning which, <hi>Chap. de Mun. Ch. Sacerdot. q.</hi> 5. they thus enquire.</p>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The expiation of sinnes under the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, is not only much different from that under the Old, but also is farre better, and more excellent: and that chiefely for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: The first is, that under the Old Testament, expiation by those legall Sacrifices was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed only for those sinnes, which happened upon imprudence and infirmity; from whence they were also called infirmities and ignoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:115372:275"/> But for greater sinnes, such as were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest transgressions of the command of God, there were no Sacrifices instituted, but the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Death was proposed to them: &amp; if God did forgive such to any, he did not do it by vertue of the Covenant, but of singular mercy, which God besides the Covenant did afford, when, and to whom he would: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Covenant, not only those sinnes are expiated, which happen by imprudence, and infirmity, but those also, which are trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions of most evident commands of God, whilest he who happened so to fall, doth not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>inue therein, but is changed by true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and falleth not into that sinne againe. The latter cause is, because under the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, expiation of sinnes was so performed, that only temporall punishment was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, whose sinnes were expiated. But under the New, the expiation is such, as not only takes away Temporall, but Eternall punishment, and in their stead, offer Eternall life promised in the Covenant, to them whose sinnes are expiated. Thus they.</q>

               <p>Some briefe Animadversions will give the Reader a cleare<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> account of this discourse. 1▪ Sundry things are here splendid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supposed by our Catechists, then which nothing could be imagined or invented more false: as (1.) That the Covenant was not the same for Substance under the Old and New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, before and after the coming of Christ in the flesh. (2.) That those under the Old Testament were not <hi>pardoned</hi> or saved by Christ. (3.) That death Temporall was all that was threatned by the Law. (4.) That God <hi>forgave sinne,</hi> and not <hi>in,</hi> or <hi>by</hi> the Covenant (5.) That there were no promises of <hi>Eternall life</hi> under the Old Testament, &amp;c. on these and the
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:115372:276"/> like goodly principles, is this whole discourse erected: let us now consider their Assertions: The first is;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>expiation</hi> by legall Sacrifices was only for <hi>some</hi> sins,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> and not of <hi>all:</hi> as sinnes of infirmity and ignorance, not great crimes; wherein 1. They <hi>suppose,</hi> that the <hi>legall Sacrifices</hi> did by themselves, and their own <hi>efficacy, expiate sinne,</hi> which is directly contrary to the discourse of the Apostle now insisted on. (2.) Their affirmation hereon is most false: <hi>Aaron</hi> making an Attonement for sinne, confessed over the Goat ALL THE INIQUITIES of the Children of Israell, and <hi>ALL their Transgressions, in all their sinnes, Levit.</hi> 16. 21. and besides, all manner of sinnes are <hi>comprised</hi> under those expressions of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances</hi> and <hi>Infirmities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They say, <hi>for greater sinnes there was then no expiation, but death was threatned to them.</hi> But then 1. None that ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <hi>such</hi> sinnes were saved; for without <hi>expiation</hi> there is no Salvation. 2. Death was threatned, and inflicted without mercy for some sinnes, as the Law with its <hi>judiciall additaments</hi> was the Rule of the <hi>Judaicall Politie;</hi> and for those sinnes, there was no Sacrifice for a <hi>deliverance</hi> from <hi>death Temporall;</hi> but Death was threatned to every sinne, small and great, as the Law was a Rule of Morall obedience unto God; and so in respect of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi> there was no distinction. This <hi>difference</hi> of Sacrifices for some sins, and not for others in particular, did depend meerly on their use by Gods appointment in the <hi>Common-wealth</hi> of that People, and had no regard to the <hi>spirituall expiation</hi> of sinne, which they typified.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That God forgave the sinnes of his people of old, by <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular mercy,</hi> and not by vertue of his Covenant, is a bold sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. God exercises no <hi>singular</hi> mercy, but in the Covenant thereof: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Their condition of Expiation (by the way) under the New Testament, <hi>that the sinner fall not againe into the same sinne,</hi> is a <hi>matter</hi> that these men understand not; but this is no place to discusse it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That the Expiation under the Old Testament reached only to the removall of <hi>temporall punishment,</hi> is another imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Catechists. It was <hi>death eternall</hi> that was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as the punishment due to the <hi>transgression</hi> of the Law, as it
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:115372:276"/> was the Rule of obedience to God, as hath been proved; even the death that Christ delivered us from, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 12, &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. God was <hi>attoned</hi> by those Sacrifices, according to their way of making Attonement, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. 30. so that the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment avoided was <hi>Eternall</hi> punishment. 2. Neither is this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed spoken by our Catechists, as though they believed any punishment should be <hi>Eternall;</hi> but they only <hi>hide</hi> themselves in ambiguity of the expression, it being <hi>annihilation</hi> they intend thereby. 3. The <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> of this discourse is, that <hi>expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation by Sacrifices</hi> was no other, then what was done really by the Sacrifices themselves, so everting their <hi>typica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="6">6. It is confessed, that there is a difference between the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation</hi> under the Old Testament, and that under the New; but this of <hi>Application</hi> and <hi>manifestation,</hi> not of <hi>impetration</hi> and <hi>procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> This is Jesus Christ, the same <hi>yesterday, to day, and for ever.</hi>

It is denied, that <hi>Paul Act:</hi> 13. 38, 39. makes a distinction of sins, whereof some might be expiated by <hi>Moses</hi> Law, and others not. He says no more there, then in this place to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> namely, that the <hi>Legall Sacrifices,</hi> wherein they rested and trusted, could not of themselves free <hi>them,</hi> or their <hi>Consciences</hi> from sin, or give them Peace with God; being but Types and Shaddowes of <hi>good things to come;</hi> the Body being Christ, by whom alone <hi>all Justification</hi> from sinne is to be obtained. Absolutely the Sacrifices of the
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:115372:277"/> Law Expiated no sinne, and so were they rested in by the Jews. Typically they expiated all, and so <hi>Paul</hi> calls them from them to the Antitype (or rather thing Typifyed) now actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited.</p>

               <p n="3">3.

               <p>This is the <hi>first thing</hi> I proposed, Christ being to <hi>offer</hi> Sacrifice,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> was not to offer the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> of old; because they could never bring about wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>Adde hereto that the mortall body of Christ, which he had before his death, yea before his Ascension into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, was not fit for his undergoing this Office of Priesthood, or wholly to accomplish the Sacrifice: wherefore the divine writer to the Hebrews Chap. 10. 5. declareth, that then he had a perfect body, accommodated unto this work, when he went into the World; that is, to come, which is Heaven.</q> An heap of foolish A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations. 1. The truth is; no body, but a Mortall body was fit to be this Sacrifice, which was to be accomplished, according to all the types of it, by shedding of blood, without which there is no remission. 2. It is false, that Christ had a <hi>mortall body</hi> after his Resurrection; or that he hath any other <hi>body</hi> now in Heaven, then what he rose withall. 3. It is false, that the World, spoken of <hi>simply,</hi> doth
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:115372:278"/> any where signify the <hi>World to come,</hi> or that the World here sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies Heaven. 4. It is false, that the <hi>coming into the World,</hi> signifies <hi>going out of the world:</hi> as it is here interpreted. 5. Christs bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, was by his <hi>Incarnation</hi> and birth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 6. according to the constant use of that expression in the Scripture, as His Assension is his <hi>leaving the world,</hi> and going to his Father, <hi>Joh:</hi> 13. 1. Cap. 14. 19. Cap. 16▪ 28.</p>
               <p>But I must not insist on this; it is the <hi>Body</hi> that God prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> Christ for his obedience, that is, his whole <hi>humane nature</hi> that is asserted for the <hi>matter</hi> of Christs offering. For the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring whereof the Reader may observe, that the matter of the Offering, and Sacrifice of Christ is expressed three wayes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is said to be of the <hi>body</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> of Christ: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 10. The offering of the <hi>body of Jesus,</hi> and the <hi>blood of Christ,</hi> is sayd to purge us from our sinnes, that is, by the Sacrifice of it; and<note place="margin">1 John 1. 7. Ephes. 1. 13.</note> in his blood have we Redemption, and by his own <hi>blood did he enter into the Holy place, Heb.</hi> 9. 12. and most expressly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 12.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His <hi>Soule: Isa. 53. 10. when thou shalt make his soule an offering for sinne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 It is most frequently sayd to be <hi>himselfe</hi> that was offered. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. &amp; <hi>Heb. 1. 3. Heb.</hi> 9. 14 &amp; <hi>v.</hi> 25. &amp; <hi>v. 26. Heb.</hi> 7. 27. Hence it appeares, what was the <hi>matter</hi> of the Sacrifice of this <hi>High Priest;</hi> even <hi>Himselfe;</hi> he <hi>Sacrificed himselfe;</hi> His whole <hi>humane nature;</hi> he offered up his <hi>body</hi> and <hi>soule,</hi> as a propitiatory Sacrifice to God; a Sacrifice for <hi>Attonement</hi> and expiation.</p>
               <p>Further to cleare this, I must desire the Reader to take notice<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> of the import of this expression: <hi>He sacrificed himselfe;</hi> or <hi>Christ Sacrificed himselfe.</hi> He in the first place, as it is spoken of the <hi>Sacrificer,</hi> denotes the <hi>Person</hi> of Christ, and both natures herein: <hi>himselfe</hi> as the Sacrificed, is only the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ wherein, and whereof that Sacrifice was made▪ He makes the <hi>Attonement actively</hi> as the Priest; Himselfe <hi>passively,</hi> as the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He is the <hi>Person of Christ,</hi> God and man joyntly and <hi>distinctly</hi> acting in the worke.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. through <hi>the Eternall Spirit he offered himselfe to God;</hi> His Eternall Spirit, or <hi>Deity,</hi> was the principall Agent, <hi>offering;</hi> and whereever there is mentioning of <hi>Christs
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:115372:278"/> offering</hi> himselfe, it relates principally to the <hi>person,</hi> God man, who offered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>free will</hi> of his humane nature was in it also; So <hi>Heb. 10. 7. Lo! I come to do thy will;</hi> when God had prepared him a <hi>body, opened his eares,</hi> he sayes, <hi>Lo I come to do thy will;</hi> as it was <hi>written</hi> of him in the <hi>volume of Gods book;</hi> and that this expression <hi>Lo I come to do thy will,</hi> sets out the readinesse of the <hi>humane will</hi> of Christ, is evident from that Exposition which is given of it, <hi>Psal. 40. 8. yea thy Law is within my heart,</hi> or in the <hi>midst of my bowels;</hi> Thy <hi>Law,</hi> the Law of the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> that I am to undertake, it is in the <hi>midst of my heart:</hi> which is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of the <hi>greatest readinesse</hi> and willingnesse possible. <hi>He</hi> then that offers is our Mediatour, God and man in one Person; and the offering is the act of the Person.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Himselfe</hi> offered, as the matter of the Sacrifice, is only the<note place="margin">§. 31.</note>
                  <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ, <hi>Soule</hi> and <hi>Body,</hi> as was said; which is evident from the description of a Sacrifice, what it is.</p>
               <p>A Sacrifice is a <hi>Religious oblation, wherein something by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of a Priest, appointed of God thereunto, is dedicated to God and destroyed, as to what it was, for the ends and purposes of Spirituall worship where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto it is instituted.</hi> I shall only take notice of that one part of this definition, which asserts that the <hi>thing</hi> Sacrificed was to be <hi>destroyed</hi> as to what it was. This is cleare from all the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices that ever were: either they were slaine, or burnt, or sent to destruction. Now the person of Christ was not dissolved; but the <hi>Ʋnion</hi> of his natures continued; even then when the <hi>humane nature</hi> was in it selfe destroyed, by the <hi>Separation</hi> of Soule and Body. It was the Soule and Body of Christ that was Sacrificed; his body being killed, and his soule separated; so that at that season it was destroyed as to what it was; though it was impossible he should be detained by death.</p>
               <p>And this Sacrifice of Christ, was <hi>typyfied</hi> by the <hi>two Go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ts▪</hi> his<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> body, whose blood was shed, by the Goat that was slaine visibly, and his soule by <hi>Azazel,</hi> on whose Head the sinnes of the people were confessed, and he is sent away into the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse to suffer there by a fall or famishment.</p>
               <p>This also will farther appeare in our following conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Death of Christ, as a <hi>punishment;</hi> when I shall shew▪ that he suffered both in <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body▪</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="408" facs="tcp:115372:279"/>
               <p>But it may be sayd, if only the <hi>humane nature</hi> of Christ was offered, how could it be a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of such infinite value, as to the justice of God, for all the sinnes of all the Elect, whereunto it was appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Asw.</hi> Though the thing Sacrificed was but finite, yet the person sacrificing was <hi>infinite;</hi> and the <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; whence the Sacrifice was of infinite value.</p>
               <p>And this is the second consideration of the Death of Christ, it was a Sacrifice; what is the peculiar influence of his death as a Sacrifice, into the satisfaction he hath made, shall be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red afterwards▪</p>
               <p>From what hath been spoken, a briefe <hi>Description</hi> of the<note place="margin">§. 33.</note> Sacrifice of Christ, as to all the <hi>concernements</hi> of it maybe taken.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The person <hi>designing, appointing,</hi> and <hi>instituting</hi> this Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is God the Father; as in <hi>grace</hi> contriving the great work of the Salvation of the Elect: A <hi>body did he prepare him;</hi> and therein he came to do his Will (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 9.) In that which he did, which the Sacrifices of old could not do. He came to fulfill the <hi>Will</hi> of God, his Appointment, &amp; Ordinance, being his Servant therein; made <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> lesse then the <hi>Father,</hi> that he might be Obedient to death: God the Father sent him when He made his <hi>soule</hi> an offering.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He to whom it was <hi>offered,</hi> was God; God <hi>Essentially</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, with his glorious Property of Justice, which was to be <hi>attoned: He gave himselefe a sacrifice to God,</hi> for a sweet smelling savour: <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 2. that is, to <hi>attone</hi> Him being provoked, as we shall see afterwards.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The person Offering was <hi>Christ</hi> the Mediatour, God and man: <hi>He offered himselfe to God: Heb.</hi> 9. 14. And because He did it, who <hi>was</hi> God and man, and as God and man, <hi>God</hi> is sayd to <hi>redeeme his Church with his own blood,</hi> Act. 20. 28.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>matter</hi> of the sacrifice was his whole <hi>humane Nature,</hi> body and soule, called himselfe, as I have shewed, in sundry particulars.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The <hi>immediate efficient</hi> cause of his offering, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of that which he offered unto God, as before descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, was his own will: <hi>Lo! I come</hi> (saith he) <hi>to do thy will:</hi> and
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:115372:279"/>
                  <hi>no man</hi> (saith he) <hi>taketh my life from me; I lay down my life, and I have power to take it up againe,</hi> Joh. 10. 17, 18. What men or Divells did to him, as what he suffered from the Curse of the Law, comes under another Consideration, as his Death was a <hi>penalty:</hi> as it was a Sacrifice his <hi>own will</hi> was all the cause immediately effecting it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The fire that was to set this <hi>Holocaust</hi> on a flame, was the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> Heb. 9. 14. Through the <hi>Eternall Spirit;</hi> that the fire which came down from Heaven, &amp; was alwayes kept <hi>alive</hi> upon the Altar, was a type of the Holy Ghost, might easily be demonstrated. I have done it elsewhere. Now the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit did this in Christ; he was <hi>offered through the Eternall Spirit;</hi> as others were by fire.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The Scripture speakes nothing of the <hi>Altar,</hi> on which Christ was offered. Some assigne the <hi>Crosse;</hi> That of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is abundantly sufficient to evince the folly thereof: <hi>Math.</hi> 23. 18, 19. If the Crosse was the <hi>Altar,</hi> it was <hi>greater</hi> then Christ, and <hi>Sanctifyed him,</hi> which is Blasphemy. Besides▪ Christ himselfe is said to be an <hi>Altar. Heb.</hi> 13. 10. and he is said to <hi>Sanctify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be an offering or a Sacrifice</hi> Joh. 17. 19. So that indeed the <hi>Deity of Christ,</hi> that supported, bore up, and sanctifyed the <hi>humane nature</hi> as offered, was the Altar; and the <hi>Crosse</hi> was but an instrument of the <hi>Cruelty</hi> of man, that taketh place in the Death of Christ as it was a penalty, but hath no place in it as a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p>That this Sacrifice of Christ was a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of propitiation, as made by blood, as answering the <hi>Typicall</hi> Sacrifices of old; that the end and effect of it was Attonement or <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> shall elsewere be more fully manifested: the Discovery of it also will in part be made, by what in the ensuing Discourse shall be spoken about Reconciliation its selfe.</p>

               <p>The Schoolemen have two Rules that passe amongst them<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> without controll. 1. That <hi>Omne peccatum est adeo voluntarium▪ ut si non sit voluntarium non est peccatum.</hi> It is so of the nature of sin, that it be <hi>voluntary,</hi> that if any thing be not <hi>voluntary,</hi> it is not sinne. The other is, <hi>est ex naturâ poenae ut sit involuntaria:</hi> it is so of the nature of Punishment, that it be <hi>against the will</hi> of him that is punished, that if it be not so, it is not punishment.</p>
               <p>Neither of which Rules is <hi>true,</hi> yea the latter is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>false.</hi> For the <hi>first,</hi> every sinne is thus farre indeed <hi>voluntary,</hi> that what is done <hi>contrary</hi> to the expresse will of him that doth it, is not his sinne; but that the <hi>actuall will,</hi> or willing of the sinner is required, to make any thing <hi>his</hi> sin, is false. In the case of <hi>originall</hi> sinne manifestly; wherefore <hi>John</hi> gives us ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther definition of sinne then theirs is, that it is, <hi>dictum, factum, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupitum contra legem;</hi> namely, that it is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>For the <hi>latter,</hi> it is true indeed, that for the most part it falls out, that every one that is to be punished, is unwilling to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergoe it; and there is an improper <hi>nolleity</hi> (if I may so speak) in nature, unto the <hi>substracting</hi> of any good from it, or the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> of any evill upon it; yet as to the perfection of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>punishment,</hi> there is no more required, then what was laid down in generall before, that there be <hi>malum passionis, ob malum actionis,</hi> a suffering of evill for doing of evill, whether men will or no.

It is that, <hi>whereby God doth right:</hi> and he gives the <hi>procuring cause</hi> of all punishment, the <hi>wickednesse</hi> of men; that be farre from thee, to <hi>destroy the righteous with the wicked.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that place of <hi>Job,</hi> chap. 9. 22. <hi>This is one thing, therefore I said it, he destroys the perfect and the wicked:</hi> Is not to be understood <hi>absolutely,</hi> but according to the <hi>subject</hi> of the dispute in hand, between him and <hi>Bildad.

He grants that a Godly man may be afflicted, which <hi>Eliphas</hi> his companion seemed to deny: yet saies he, he will not <hi>cast him away,</hi> that is, leave him without reliefe from that Affliction, even in this Life. To this <hi>Jobs</hi> answer is, <hi>this is one thing;</hi> that is, one thing I am resolved on, and therefore <hi>I said it,</hi> and will abide by it, <hi>he destroyeth the perfect and the wicked;</hi> not only Wicked men are destroyed, and cut off in this life, but Perfect men also; but yet in this very destruction, as there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the persons, one being <hi>perfect,</hi> the other <hi>wicked:</hi> So there is in Gods dealing with them; one being afflicted to the doore of <hi>Heaven,</hi> the other <hi>cursed</hi> into Hell.

               <p>This is <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>vindicta noxae;</hi> purely the recompensing of the evill that is committed, that it may be revenged. This (I say) in Gods dealing is <hi>properly punishment,</hi> the <hi>revenge of the evill done,</hi> that himselfe, or his justice may be satisfyed, as was seen before, from <hi>Rom. 2. 7, 8, 9. verse.</hi> Whatever of evill God doth to any, which is therefore called <hi>punishment,</hi> because it parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of the <hi>generall</hi> nature of punishment, and is evill to him that is punished; yet if the intendment of God be not to revenge the evill past upon him, in a proportion of Law, it is not punishment properly so called. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will not suffice to prove that Believers are, or may be punished for sinne, to heap up Texts of Scripture, where they are said to be <hi>punished,</hi> and that in reference to their sinne; unlesse it can be also proved, that God doth it <hi>animo ulciscendi,</hi> and that their punishment is <hi>vindicta noxae,</hi> and that it is done <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>: but of this I am not now to treat. The Reader may hence see what punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is in generall; what are the <hi>ends</hi> of it, and its kinds from thence; &amp; what is punishment from God, properly so called. It is <hi>vindicta noxae, animo ulciscendi, ut ipsi satisfiat:</hi> and this kind of punishment was the death of Christ: which is to be proved.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the death of Christ was a punishment properly<note place="margin">§. 14.</note> so called, which is the third consideration of it, as I said, is next to be proved. Of all the places of Scripture and Testimonys whereby this may be demonstrated, I shall fix only on <hi>one</hi> por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Scripture: and that is <hi>Isai.</hi> 53. What in particular shall be produced from thence; will appeare when I have given
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:115372:284"/> some generall Considerations of the Chapter, which I shall do at large, as looking on that Portion of Scripture as the sum of what is spoken in the old Testament, concerning the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory Death of Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This whole Prophesy from▪ <hi>v.</hi> 13. of <hi>chap.</hi> 52. which is<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> the head of the present Discourse, is evinced to belong to the <hi>Messias,</hi> against the <hi>Jewes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Because the <hi>Chaldee Paraphrast,</hi> one of their most ancient Masters, expressly names the <hi>Messias,</hi> and interprets that whole Chapter of him; <hi>behold</hi> (saith he) <hi>my servant the Messias shall deale prudently.</hi> And the Ancient <hi>Rabbins,</hi> as is abundantly proved by others, were of the same mind. Which miserably intangles their present <hi>obdurate</hi> Masters, who would fixe the Prophesy upon any, rather then on the Messias. Seeing evidently, that if it be proved to belong to the <hi>Messias</hi> in <hi>Thesi,</hi> it can be applyed to none other in <hi>Hypothesi,</hi> but <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Because they are not able to find out, or fixe on any<note place="margin">§. 16.</note> one whatever, to whom the things here spoken of, may be accomodated. They speak indeed of <hi>Ieremiah, Iosias, a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man</hi> in generall, the <hi>whole people of Israel;</hi> of <hi>Messiah Ben Ioseph,</hi> a man of Straw of their own setting up; but it is easy to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, were that our present work, that scarce any one Expression, in this Prophesy, much lesse <hi>all,</hi> do or can agree to any one, or all of them named, so that it must be brought home to its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per subject: of this at large in the ensuing digression against <hi>Grotius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. That to us it is evident above all contradiction, that the<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> whole belongs to <hi>Iesus</hi> Christ; because not only paticular Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies are taken from hence in the <hi>New Testament</hi> and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, as <hi>Mat. 8. 17. Mark. 15 28. Luk. 22. 37. Rom</hi> 10. 16. but it is also expounded of him in generall for the Conversion of soules, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 28. The story is knowne of <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Eunuch.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This is such a Prophesy of Christ, as belongs to him not<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> only <hi>properly,</hi> but <hi>immediately:</hi> that is, it doth not in the first place point out any Type of Christ, and by him shaddow out Christ, as it is in sundry Psalmes, where <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> are <hi>firstly</hi> spoken of, though the <hi>Messias</hi> be principally intended: but here is no such thing. Christ himself is immediately spoken
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:115372:284"/> of. <hi>Socinus</hi> sayes indeed, that he <hi>doubted not but that these things did primarily belong to another,</hi> could he be discovered, who he was; and that from Him was the Allusion taken, and the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation made to Christ: and if (saith he) <hi>it could be found out who he was,</hi> much light might be given into many expressions in the Chapter. But this is a <hi>bold figment,</hi> for which there is not the least countenance given either from Scripture or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; which is evidently decryed from the former Arguments, whereby the impudency of the Jewes is confounded: And shall be farther in the ensuing <hi>digression</hi> where it shall be proved that it is impossible to fix on any <hi>one</hi> but <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> to whom the severall expressions, and matters expressed in this <hi>Prophesy</hi> may be accommodated.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now there are three <hi>generall parts</hi> of this Prophesy, to<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> consider it with Reference to the businesse in hand: As the seat of this Truth in the old Testament.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A description given of Christ, in a <hi>mean, low, misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble condition,</hi> from <hi>v.</hi> 14. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 52. to <hi>v.</hi> 5. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 53. His <hi>visage was marred, and his forme, more then the Sonnes of men, he hath no forme, nor comelinesse</hi> v. 2. <hi>No beauty, a man of griefe, and sorrowes, despised, neglected, acquainted with griefe,</hi> v. 3. looked on <hi>as stricken and aflicted of God.</hi> v. 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reason is given of this Representation of the <hi>Messias,</hi> of whom it is said in the entrance of the Prophesy, that he should deale <hi>prudently, and be exalted, and extolled, and be very high.</hi> To which this description of him seemes most adverse and contrary. The Reason (I say) hereof is given from <hi>v.</hi> 5. to the 10. it was on the account of his being punished, and <hi>broken</hi> for us, and our sinnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The issue of all this from <hi>v.</hi> 10. to the end, is the Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Salvation of Believers.</p>
               <p>It is the second that I shall insist upon, to prove the Death of Christ, to have in it the nature of <hi>punishment,</hi> properly and strictly so called.</p>
               <p>Not to insist upon all the particular passages, that might be<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> done to great advantage, and ought to be done, did I purpose the <hi>through,</hi> and <hi>full</hi> handling of the businesse before me, (but I am <hi>in transitu,</hi> and pressing to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>omewhat farther) I shall only urge two things.</p>

               <p n="2">2. One or two singular Assertions, <hi>comprehensive</hi> of much of the rest.</p>
               <p>For the the first, let the Reader consider what is contained in<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> the severall words, here setting forth the condition of Christ: we have, <hi>despising</hi> and <hi>rejecting, sorrow</hi> and <hi>griefe,</hi> v. 4. He was <hi>stricken, smitten, afflicted;</hi> or there was <hi>striking, smiting, affliction</hi> on him. <hi>Wounded, bruised, chastised with stripes,</hi> v. 5. <hi>wounding, bruising, chastising</hi> unto sorenesse, <hi>oppressed, stricken, cut off, killed, brought to slaughter,</hi> v. 7, 8, 9. <hi>Bruised, sacrificed,</hi> and his <hi>soule made a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now certainely for the <hi>materiall</hi> part, or the matter of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, here it is abundantly: here is <hi>malum passionis</hi> in every kind. <hi>Immission</hi> of evill, <hi>substraction</hi> of Good in soule and body: here is plentifull measure <hi>heaped up, shaken together, and running over.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But it may be said, though here be the <hi>matter</hi> of punishment,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> yet it may be all this was for some other end; and so it may be it was (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, or punishment <hi>properly</hi> so called.</p>
               <p>Consider then the ends of punishment before insisted on▪ and see what of them is applicable to the <hi>Transaction▪</hi> betweene God and Christ here mentioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Was it for his <hi>own Correction?</hi> No sayes the Prophet, <hi>v. 9. He had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth:</hi> He was perfectly innocent. So that he had no need of any <hi>Chastisement</hi> for his Amendment; and so signally in sundry pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where mention is made of the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, his own <hi>spotlesse innocency</hi> is often pleaded. Neither was it for his <hi>instruction</hi> that he <hi>might be wise,</hi> and <hi>instructed</hi> in the will of God; for at the very entrance of the Prophesy, Chap. 52. 13. he sayes, he shall deale prudently and be exalted. He was Faithfull before in all things. And though he <hi>experimentally</hi> learned obedience, by his sufferings, yet habitually to the utmost his <hi>eares were bored,</hi> and himselfe prepared to the will of God, before the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here principally intended.

Yea to make that the maine intendment here, is a monstrous figment.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Then, the matter of punishment being expressed, see<note place="margin">§ 23▪</note> the cause of the infliction of it. It was for <hi>Transgressions,</hi> for <hi>iniquities,</hi> v. 5. For <hi>wandring</hi> and <hi>iniquity,</hi> v. 6. For <hi>Transgressions, v.</hi> 8. For <hi>sinne,</hi> v 12. Let us now remember the generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of punishment that was given at the beginning; It is <hi>Malum passionis quod infligitur ob malum actionis,</hi> and see how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly it suits with this punishment of Jesus Christ. 1. Here is <hi>malum passionis inflicted, wounding, bruising, killing.</hi> And 2. there is <hi>malū actionis deserving, sinne, iniquity,</hi> and <hi>transgression.</hi> How these met on an innocent person, shall be afterwards declared. 2.

It is <hi>vindicta noxae;</hi> now if all other ends and causes whatever, as of <hi>Chastisement</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> &amp;c. be removed, and this only be <hi>asserted,</hi> then this Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Christ was <hi>vindicta noxae,</hi> punishment in the most <hi>proper</hi> sence; but that these ends are so removed hath been declared upon the particular consideration of them.</p>
               <p>And this is the first Argument from this place to prove; that the Death of Christ and his <hi>suffering,</hi> hath the nature of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>

               <p>THE two Expressions that I chose in <hi>particular</hi> to <hi>consider,</hi> are<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> nextly to be insisted on.</p>
               <p>The first relates to <hi>Him,</hi> who did inflict the punishment. The other to him that was punished.</p>
               <p>The first in v. 6. <hi>The Lord laid on him the iniquityes of us all.</hi> The person <hi>punishing,</hi> is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the person punished called <hi>Him;</hi> that is, he who is spoken of throughout the whole Prophesy; the <hi>Messiah Jesus Christ,</hi> as above declared.</p>

                  </gap> to which all<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> the significations mentioned, are assigned; <hi>Occurrere, obviam ire, incurrere, aggredi, rogare, precari:</hi> The first generall signification of it is to <hi>meet,</hi> as the bounds of a Field, or Country, or house, meet with one another. <hi>Ioshuah</hi> 19. 34. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> So all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long in that chapter, where the bounds of one Country, are said to reach to another; that is, to meet with them; it is the word here used. So in voluntary Agents, it is <hi>obviam ire,</hi> or to meet, and that either for <hi>good or evill;</hi> for good it is spoken of God, <hi>Psal</hi> 64. 5. thou meetest him, &amp;c. and so for evill <hi>Amos▪ 5. 19. as if a man fled from a Lyon, and a Beare meet him:</hi>

                  </gap> that is, to <hi>teare him</hi> in pieces. Hence because men that met others, went to them, to desire some help of them, the word also signifies to <hi>aske,</hi> to <hi>pray, entreat,</hi> or <hi>intercede;</hi> so the word is used <hi>Isa.</hi> 59. 16. there was no <hi>entreater,</hi>

                  </gap> none to <hi>meet,</hi> to <hi>come</hi> and aske. And in this very chap. v. 12. he made <hi>intercession for the transgress<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;</hi> the word is the same with that here used▪ to meet the <hi>Lord,</hi> and intercede for transgressors, to stay his hand against them, is its sence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To <hi>meet, or to make to meet</hi> properly, which is the First, and most cleare sence of the word. It is often used for to meet <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo hostili,</hi> to meet, to <hi>fall</hi> upon for hurt, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nextly, it may be enquired in what sence the word is here<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> used, whether in the first spoken of, to <hi>aske, entreat, intercede;</hi> or in the latter, to <hi>meet;</hi> or to <hi>meet with.</hi>

For the word, it is 46 times used in the Old Testament, and if in any one of them it may be truly rendred <hi>permisit,</hi> as it is done by him, or to that sence, let it be here so applied also. And for that sence, which
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:115372:287"/> is, that God suffered the Jews by their wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>kednesse to <hi>intreat</hi> him evilly, it is most remote from the intendment of the words, and the Holy Ghost in them.</p>
               <p n="1">1. First then, that the words cannot be interpreted to <hi>pray,</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercede,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> is evident frō the <hi>contexture;</hi> wherein it is said (in <hi>this</hi> sence) <hi>he prayed him for the iniquity of us all;</hi> that is, the Lord prayed Christ for the iniquities of us all. This sence of the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> in this place, <hi>Socinus</hi> himselfe grants not to be proper, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent. <hi>Porro significatio illa, precari, in loco nostro locum habere non potest; alioqui sequeretur Isaiam voluisse dicere, Deum fecisse, ut omnium nostrûm iniquitas per Christum, vel pro Christo precata fuerit, quod longe absurdissimum esse nemo non videt▪ cap. 21. p. 132. Praelec. Socin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is then <hi>to meet:</hi> now the word here used being in <hi>Hiphil,</hi> which makes a double Action of that expressed by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Cause, by whose Power, vertue, and <hi>impresse,</hi> the thing is done; thence it is here rendred <hi>occurrere fecit,</hi> he made to meet, and so the sence of it is, God <hi>made our sinnes,</hi> as it were, to <hi>set up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or to fall upon <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> which is the most common use of the word, as hath been shewed.</p>
               <p>It is objected, that the word signifies <hi>to meet,</hi> yet no more but<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> this may be the meaning of them; <hi>God in Christ met with all our iniquities;</hi> that is, for their pardoning, and removall, &amp; taking away▪</p>
               <p>Of the many things that may be given in for the eversion of this <hi>Glosse,</hi> I shall name only two, whereof the first is to the <hi>word,</hi> the latter to the <hi>matter.</hi> For the <hi>word;</hi> the <hi>Conjugation</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common Rule, enforces the sence formerly mentioned; <hi>he made to meet,</hi> and not <hi>he met.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Prophet in <hi>these words</hi> renders a reason of the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible</hi> sad condition of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> at which so many were <hi>scandalized,</hi> and whereupon so few believed the report of the Gospel concerning him; and this is, that <hi>God laid on him our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities;</hi> now there is no reason why he should be represented in so <hi>deplorable</hi> a state and condition, if God only <hi>met</hi> with, &amp; <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented</hi> our sinne, in and by him, which he did (as they say) in his Resurrection, wherein he was exceeding Glorious; so that the meaning of the word is, that God made <hi>our sinnes to meet on him,</hi> by laying them on him; and this sence <hi>Socinus</hi> himselfe consents unto, <hi>Praelec. cap. 21. p.</hi> 133. But this also will farther
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:115372:287"/> appeare in the explication of the next word: and that is, <hi>our iniquities.</hi>
               </p>

                  </gap> How the Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of us, that is, the <hi>punishment</hi> of our iniquity? I shall offer three things, to make good this interpretation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>word</hi> is often found in that sence; so that it is<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> no new, or uncouth thing, that here it should be so, <hi>Gen. 4. 13. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> mine iniquity</hi> is greater then I can beare, it is the same <hi>word</hi> here used; they are the words of <hi>Cain,</hi> upon the denuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God's judgement on him; and what <hi>iniquity</hi> it is, he gives you an account in the next <hi>words, behold thou hast cast me out,</hi> v▪ 14. that was only the <hi>punishment▪</hi> laid on him. It is used in like manner severall times <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. 17, 19. and 1 <hi>Sam. 28. 10.

And also in sundry other places: so that this is no <hi>new</hi> signification of the word, and is here most proper.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It appears from the explication that is given of this thing<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> in many other expressions is the Chapt. <hi>God laid on him the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of us all.</hi> How? in that it pleased him to <hi>bruise him,</hi> and <hi>put him to griefe,</hi> v. 10.

               <p>Thus in the <hi>laying our sinne on Christ,</hi> there was a two fold Act of God: one as a <hi>Governour,</hi> the other as a <hi>Judge</hi> properly.<note place="margin">§. 15▪</note>

               <p n="1">1. That as this whole thing was done in the <hi>Justice</hi> of God, as hath been declared, so it was done by the <hi>Counsell</hi> and <hi>Appointment</hi> of God.

Now as laying of our sinnes on Christ, being designed our Mediatour, and undertaking the worke, was an act of God, as the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> of all, and the <hi>righteous</hi> Judge, so this of the <hi>determinate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell,</hi> and <hi>fore appointment,</hi> or the <hi>eternall designation</hi> of Christ to his <hi>office,</hi> is an Act of <hi>Soveraigne power</hi> and Dominion in God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by

So he would determine, that Christ should beare our iniquities, when he might otherwise have disposed of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 34, 35, 36, 37.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In respect of us, this <hi>preappointment</hi> of God was an act<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> of Grace, that is, a sovereigne Act of his <hi>good pleasure,</hi> whence all good things, all fruits of Love whatever to us doe flow. Therefore it is called <hi>Love,</hi> Joh. 3. 16. and so in the fruit of it is it expressed, Rom. 8. 32. And on this <hi>John</hi> often insists in his Gospell and Epist: 1 Joh. 4. 9, 10, 11. His aime on his own part was the declaration of his <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> Rom. 3. 25. and to make way for the praise of his <hi>glorious grace,</hi> Eph. 1. 6. on <hi>our parts,</hi> that we might have all those <hi>good things,</hi> which are the <hi>fruits</hi> of the most intense Love.<note place="margin">§. 20.</note>

That Christ himself was <hi>willing</hi> to undergoe this burthen &amp; <hi>undertake</hi> this work: &amp; this as it is consistent with his <hi>death</hi> being a <hi>punishment,</hi> so it is of necessity to make good the other Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of it, namely, that it should be a <hi>price, and a Sacrifice.</hi> For no man gives a price, &amp; therein parts with that which is precious to him <hi>unwillingly;</hi> nor is a Sacrifice acceptable that comes not from a <hi>free</hi> &amp; <hi>willing minde.</hi> That he was thus willing himselfe professeth, both in the undertaking &amp; carrying of it on; in the undertaking, <hi>Heb. 10. 9.

                  <hi>looked on the Church through the window of the promise,</hi> and the <hi>Lattice</hi> of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> ceremonies.</p>
               <p>And what discovery do they make of him, in the view they take in the <hi>broad light</hi> of the <hi>Promises,</hi> and the many glimpses of the <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Types. They see him coming, <hi>leaping on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and skipping on the hills,</hi> coming speedily with a great deale of Joy and willingnesse.</p>
               <p>So of himselfe he declares what his minde was from of old, from everlasting, <hi>Prov. 8. 30, 31.

               <p>Not to make many <hi>Words,</hi> nor to multiply Interpretations, and Accommodations of these places, which may be seen in <hi>them,</hi> who have to good purpose made it their businesse to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>paralell places</hi> of the Old and New Testaments, and to Reconcile them: I say only, it is no New thing to have the Effect and <hi>Evidence,</hi> and end of a thing, spoken of in the New Testament, in Answer to the Cause, and Rise of it, mentioned in the Old, by the application of the same <hi>words</hi> unto it which they are mentioned in. For instance, <hi>Paul Eph.</hi> 4. 8. citing that of the <hi>Psalmist, Psal.</hi> 68. 18. Thou hast <hi>ascended up on high, and hast led Captivity Captive, and received gifts for men;</hi> renders it; when he ascended up on high, he <hi>led Captivity Captive, and gave gifts unto Men;</hi> and that because his <hi>giving of them,</hi> was the <hi>end</hi> of his <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> of them; and his <hi>receiving</hi> of them, the Foundation of his <hi>giving</hi> of them▪ the Effect and Fruit being here expressed, the Foundation and Ground supposed.</p>
               <p>So also, <hi>Mine eares hast thou bored, Psal.</hi> 40. is rendred, <hi>a body hast▪ thou prepared me, Heb:</hi> 10. because the end of the <hi>boring the eare</hi> of Christ was, that he might <hi>offer his body a Sacrifice</hi> to God; So it is here in this place of <hi>Mathew:</hi> Christ his taking away the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Distempers, and Sicknesses of men, was an Effect, and an Evidence of his <hi>taking away their sinne,</hi> which was done by <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of them; And therefore <hi>Mathew</hi> mentioning the Effect and Evidence of the thing, doth it in the Words that expresse the
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:115372:292"/> Cause and Foundation of it. Not, that, that was a compleat Accomplishment of what was foretold, but that it was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated in the Effect and evidence of it. Nor do the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> themselves think that this was a full accomplishment of what is spoken by the Prophet, themselves insisting on another interpretation of the words: So that notwithstanding these exceptions, the Word here may have its Proper signification of <hi>bearing</hi> or <hi>carrying;</hi> which also that it hath, may be farther evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here is no cogent Reason, why the <hi>Metaphoricall</hi> use of the<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> Word should be understood. When it is spoken of <hi>God,</hi> there is a Necessity, that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> should be interpreted by the Effect; because Properly he cannot <hi>beare,</hi> nor <hi>undergoe▪ griefe, sorrow,</hi> or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment. But as to the <hi>Mediator,</hi> the case is otherwise, For he <hi>confessedly</hi> underwent these things Properly, wherein we say that this word <hi>Bearing</hi> of Punishment doth consist; He was <hi>so bruised, so broken, so slaine:</hi> So that there is no Reason to depart from the Propriety of the Word.</p>

               <p>The close of these words is; <hi>That which had not been told them shall they see, and that which they had not heard, shall they consider.</hi> Of which he sayes; <hi>They shall see that come to passe, foreseen and foretold by him, which they not heard of by their Astrologers or Magitians.</hi>

               <p>It is of the unworthy dealing of the Iewes with the Prophet in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> during the seige, that he supposes these words are spoken, and spoken by the <hi>Iewes</hi> after the taking of the Citty.

Or did they <hi>beare</hi> their own sinnes?

<pb n="547" facs="tcp:115372:306"/> The sence that <hi>Grotius</hi> fixes on, is, that <hi>God delivered Ieremiah from death, and gave others to be slaine in his steed, who had contrived his death.</hi> But</p>

               <p>HAving dispatched this <hi>Digression,</hi> I returne again to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration<note place="margin">§. 1.</note> of the death of Christ, as it was a <hi>punishment</hi> which shall now be pursued unto its issue.</p>
               <p>The third thing proposed to the Consideration on this <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> was the <hi>matter</hi> of this punishment that Christ underwent which is commonly expressed by the name of his Death.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Death</hi> is a name comprehensive of all <hi>evill,</hi> of what nature, or of what kind soever: All that was threatned, all that was ever inflicted on man: though much of it fall within the compas of this life, and short of death, yet it is evill purely on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its <hi>Relation</hi> to Death, and its tendency thereunto; which when it is taken away, it is no more <hi>generally,</hi> and <hi>absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> evill, but in some regard only.</p>

               <p>To say that the death <hi>threatned</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> was <hi>one,</hi> and that Christ underwent <hi>another,</hi> that Eternall, <hi>this</hi> Temporall, and
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:115372:316"/> so also of the <hi>curse,</hi> &amp; desertion threatned, (besides what shall be said afterward) would render the whole businesse of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation <hi>unintelligible,</hi> as being revealed in termes equivocall no where explained.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is not the least <hi>intimation</hi> in the whole book of God, of any <hi>change</hi> of the punishment, in reference to the <hi>surety</hi> from what it was, or should have been, in respect of the <hi>sinner.</hi> God made all <hi>our iniquities to meet on him;</hi> that is, (as hath been declared) the <hi>punishment</hi> due to them.

                  </gap>serve one punishment, and Christ undergoe another? Was it the sentence of the Law, that was executed on him, or was it some other thing, that he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to? It is said, that he was <hi>made under the Law, Gal.</hi> 4. 4. that sin was <hi>condemned in his flesh,</hi> Ro. 8. 3 that <hi>God spared him not</hi> Ro. 8. 31. that he <hi>tasted death;</hi> that he was <hi>made a curse;</hi> all relating to the Law: that he suffered more or lesse there is no mention.</p>
               <p>It is strange to me, that we should deserve <hi>one</hi> punishment, and he who is punished for us, undergoe <hi>another;</hi> yet both of them be constantly described by the same <hi>names,</hi> and Titles. If God laid the punishment of our sinnes on Christ, certainely it was the punishment that was due to them; mention is every where made of a <hi>commutation</hi> of Persons, the <hi>just</hi> suffering for the unjust, the <hi>sponsor</hi> for the <hi>offender,</hi> his name as a <hi>surety</hi> being taken into the <hi>obligation,</hi> and the whole debt required of him; but of a <hi>change</hi> of punishment, there is no mention at all. And there is this desperate consequence that wil be made readily, upon a supposall that any lesse then the <hi>curse</hi> of the Law and death, in the nature of it <hi>eternall,</hi> was inflicted on Christ, namely, that God indeed is not <hi>such a sore revenger of sinne,</hi> as in the Scripture he is proposed to be; but can passe it by in the way of composition on much easier termes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The punishment due to us, that is in the <hi>curse of the Law,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 29.</note> consists (as was said,) of two parts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Losse,</hi> or separation from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Sence,</hi> from the infliction of the evill threatned; and both these did our Saviour undergoe.</p>
               <p>For the first, it is expressed of him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 22. 1. and he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally complaines of it himselfe, <hi>Math.</hi> 27. 46. and of this <hi>cry</hi> for a while, he sayes, <hi>O my God, I cry in the day time and thou hearest not

Adde but this one consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of what is affirmed of him, that he <hi>tasted death</hi> for us <hi>Heb:</hi> 2. 9. and this will be cleared. What death was it he tasted? The death that had the curse attending it, <hi>Gal:</hi> 3. 13.

               <p>And to make it yet more <hi>cleare,</hi> it was by <hi>death</hi> that he delivered us from death, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14, 15. and if he dyed only a temporall death, he delivered us only from temporall death, as a punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

He shall never see death;</hi> that is, eternall death, for every <hi>Believer</hi> shall see death temporall.</p>
               <p>On these considerations it is evident, that the sufferings of<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> Christ in <hi>relation</hi> to the Law, were the <hi>very same</hi> that were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to sinners, and which we should have undergone, had not our surety undertaken the worke for us. Neither was there any difference in reference to God the <hi>Judge,</hi> and the sentence of the law, but only this, that the <hi>same Person</hi> who offended, did not suffer▪ and that those consequences of the <hi>punishment</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, which attend the <hi>offenders</hi> own suffering, could have no place in him; but this being not the maine of my present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe, I shall no farther insist on it.</p>
               <p>Only I marvell, that any should think to implead this truth<note place="margin">§. 32▪</note> of Christs suffering the same that we did, by saying that <hi>Christs
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:115372:318"/> obligation</hi> to punishment was <hi>sponsionis propriae,</hi> ours <hi>violatae legis:</hi> As though it were the manner how Christ came to be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to punishment, and not <hi>what punishment</hi> he underwent, that is asserted when we say, that he underwent the <hi>same</hi> that we should have done. But as to say, that Christ became <hi>obnoxious</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment the same way that we do, or did, that is, by sinne of his own, is <hi>blasphemy:</hi> so to say he did not upon his own <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> undertaking, undergoe the <hi>same,</hi> is little lesse.

               <p>Thus though this Covenant be <hi>Eternall,</hi> and the object of it<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> be that which might <hi>not</hi> have been, and so it hath the nature of the residue of Gods <hi>decrees</hi> in those regards, yet because of this distinct acting of the Will of the Father, &amp; the will of the Son, with regard to each other, it is more then a decree, and hath the proper nature of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> or <hi>Compact</hi> Hence from the <hi>moment</hi> of it (I speake not of time) there is a new habitude of Will in the Father and Sonne towards each other, that is not in them essentially; I call it <hi>new,</hi> as being in God <hi>freely,</hi> not <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally.</hi> And hence was the salvation of men before the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> by the undertaking, mediation, and death of Christ.

               <p>The Revelation of this Covenant is in the Scripture: not that<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> it was then <hi>constituted,</hi> when it is first <hi>mentioned</hi> in the Promises and Prophesies of Christ, but then first <hi>declared</hi> or revealed. Christ was Declared to be the Sonne of God, by the <hi>Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from the dead; but he <hi>was</hi> so from Eternity. As in other
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:115372:319"/> places as shall be evinced, so in <hi>Isa.</hi> 53. is this Covenant men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; in which Chapter there is this <hi>Propheticall Scheme;</hi> the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> between Father and Sonne, which was <hi>past,</hi> is spoken of as <hi>to come;</hi> and the <hi>sufferings</hi> of Christ, which were <hi>to come,</hi> are spoken of as <hi>past,</hi> as appears to every one that but reads the Chapter. It is also signally ascribed to Christs coming into the World: not <hi>constitutively,</hi> but <hi>declaratively.</hi> It is the greatest folly about such things as these, to suppose them then <hi>done,</hi> when <hi>revealed,</hi> though <hi>revealed</hi> in expressions of <hi>doing</hi> them. These things being premised, I proceed to manifest, how this Covenant is in the Scripture declared.</p>
               <p>Now this <hi>Convention</hi> or Agreement, as elsewhere, so it is most<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> cleerely expressed, <hi>Heb:</hi> 10. from <hi>Ps. 40. Lo! I come to do thy will O God.</hi> And what Will? v. 10. <hi>The Will by which we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Iesus once for all.</hi> The Will of God was, that <hi>Jesus</hi> should be <hi>offered;</hi> and to this End, that we might be <hi>sanctified</hi> and saved: It is called the <hi>offering of the body of Jesus,</hi> in Answer to what was said before, <hi>a body hast thou prepared mee;</hi> or an <hi>humane nature,</hi> by a <hi>Synechdoche.</hi> My <hi>Will,</hi> says God the Father, is, that thou <hi>have a body,</hi> and that that <hi>body be offered</hi> up, and that to this end, that the <hi>Children,</hi> the Elect might be san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified: Sayes the Sonne to this, <hi>Lo, I am come to do thy Will.</hi> I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Condition, and give up my selfe to the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of thy Will.</p>
               <p>To make this more distintly evident, the nature of such a<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> compact, Agreement, or <hi>convention,</hi> as depends on personall <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> such as this, may be a little considered.</p>
               <p>There are five things required to the compleat establishing, and accomplishing of such a <hi>compact</hi> &amp; agreement: 1. That there be sundry Persons, <hi>two</hi> at least, namely a Promiser, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, <hi>agreeing</hi>

               <p n="3">3.

Hence our Reconciliation, Justification, yea our salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are in the Scripture spoken of, as things <hi>actually</hi> done and accomplished, in the <hi>death,</hi> and <hi>blood-shedding</hi> of Jesus Christ, not as though we were all then <hi>actually</hi> justified and saved, but upon the account of the certainty of the <hi>performance,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment of those things in their <hi>due</hi> time towards us, and upon us, are these things so delivered: for in <hi>reference</hi> to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of Christ in this <hi>Covenant,</hi> is he called the <hi>second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi> becoming a <hi>common head</hi> to his people, with this difference; that <hi>Adam</hi> was a <hi>common head</hi> to all that came of him, <hi>necessarily,</hi> and as I may so say, <hi>naturally,</hi> and whether he would or no; Christ is so to his, <hi>voluntarily,</hi> and by his <hi>own consent</hi> and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, as hath been demonstrated; now as we all dye in <hi>Adam faederally</hi> and <hi>Meritoriously,</hi> yet the severall <hi>individualls</hi> are not in their persons actually <hi>dead</hi> in sinne, and <hi>obnoxious</hi> to eternall death, before they are by naturall Generation united to <hi>Adam,</hi> their first head; So though all the Elect be <hi>made alive,</hi> and <hi>saved faederally</hi> and <hi>meritoriously</hi> in the Death of Christ, wherein also a <hi>certain</hi> foundation is laid of that efficacy, which workes all these things in us, and for us, yet we are not <hi>viritim</hi> made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the good things mentioned, before we are <hi>united</hi> to Christ, by the communication of his spirit to us.</p>
               <p>And this I say is the <hi>Covenant</hi> and Compact, that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> Father and Sonne, which is the great foundation of what hath been said, and shall farther be spoken, about the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of Christ; here lyes the ground of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:115372:324"/> of the dispensation treated of: That Christ should undergoe the <hi>punishment</hi> due to us, it was done <hi>voluntarily</hi> of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe; and he did nothing but what he had <hi>power</hi> to doe, and <hi>command</hi> from his Father to doe; <hi>I have power,</hi> saith he, <hi>to lay downe my life, and Power to take it againe, this command have I received of my Father;</hi> whereby the glory both of the Love, and justice of God is exceedingly exalted.

It is true, if he that is to <hi>suffer,</hi> or he that is to <hi>punish,</hi> be not <hi>willing,</hi> or agreed to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatin: But here <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Sonne</hi> as hath been manifested, were fully agreed upon the whole matter.

               <p>To remove these <hi>difficulties</hi> (if they may be so called) I shall only tender the ensuing considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That because Redemption is sometime to be taken <hi>Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 10.</note> for meere deliverance, when it is spoken of God without any mention of a Price or Ransome, in such <hi>cases</hi> as wherein it was impossible that a <hi>Ransome</hi> should be paid (as in the <hi>deliverance of the Childrem of Israel from Aegypt,</hi> &amp; <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>)<note place="margin">Deut. 4. 34.</note> when it is expressly said to be done by <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>outstretched arme,</hi> therefore it must be so understood, when it is spoken of Christ the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> with expresse <hi>mention of a price</hi> or Ransome, &amp; when it was <hi>impossible</hi> but that a <hi>ransome</hi> must be paid, is a loose consequence, not deserving any notice.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all the places of Scripture, where mention is made<note place="margin">§. 11.</note> of God being a <hi>Redeemer,</hi> and <hi>Rededming</hi> his people, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred unto these heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Such as call God the Redeemer of his Church in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, as the places before mentioned; and these are all to be referred immediately to the <hi>Sonne</hi> of God, (the manner of his Redemption being described in the <hi>New Testament</hi>) and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Redemption</hi> is intended in them. <hi>Is.</hi> 54. 5, 6. with <hi>Ep.</hi> 5. 25▪ 26.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Such as mention some temporall deliverance, that was Typicall of the <hi>Spirituall Redemption,</hi> which we have by Jesus Christ; and it is called <hi>Redmption,</hi> not so much from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:115372:327"/> nature of <hi>deliverance,</hi> as from its <hi>pointing</hi> out to us that <hi>reall</hi> and <hi>proper</hi> Redemption, that was <hi>typifyed</hi> by it. Such was Gods <hi>redeeming</hi> his people out of Aegypt▪ So there is no mention of Redemption in the Scripture, but either it is proper, or receives that <hi>Apellation</hi> from its Relation to that which is so.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This is indeed a very wretched and cursed way<note place="margin">§. 12.</note> of interpreting Scripture, especially those passages of it which set out the <hi>grace</hi> of God, and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Much lesse can it be once <hi>imagined,</hi> that God has expressed his <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Kindnesse,</hi> and the fruits of it to us, in great and <hi>weighty</hi> words, that in their ordinary use and significancy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine a great deale more then really he hath done? for any one so to interpret what he hath spoken, is an Abomination, into which I desire my soule may never enter.</p>

               <p n="2">2. It is the delivery of one in captivity; all men considered<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> in the state of sinne, and alienation from God are in captivity.

               <p>So also are they called <hi>Captives</hi> expressly, <hi>Isa. 49. 25. Thus</hi>

                  <hi>saith the Lord, even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered;</hi> those who were in their <hi>captivity</hi> a prey to Sathan, that mighty and cruell one, shall be delivered; and who shall do this? <hi>The Lord thy Saviour, and thy Redeemer, the Mighty one of Jacob,</hi> v. 26. He proclaimes liberty to the Captives. <hi>Isa. 61. 1. Luk.</hi> 4. 18.

Eph. 4. 8. that is, either captivity active<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Sathan who held and detained <hi>his</hi> in captivity, or passively those who were in captivity to him.</p>
               <p>Thus being both Prisoners and Captives they are said to be in Bondage; Christ gives us liberty from that yoak of bondage. <hi>Gal</hi> 5. 1. and men are in Bondage by reason of <hi>death all their dayes, Heb.</hi> 2. 14. There is indeed nothing that the Scripture more abounds in, then this, that men in the state of sinne are in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, Captivity, &amp; Bondage, are Captives, Prisoners, and Slaves.</p>
               <p>Concerning this two things are considerable.</p>

                     </note> which witnesse that we are redeemed of Christ?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It is hence evident, that satisfaction cannot be confirmed from the word Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, because it is written of God himselfe, both in the Old and New Testament, that he redeemed his people. 2. Because it is written that God redeemed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and that <hi>Moses</hi> was a Redeemer, and that we are redeemed from our iniquities, and our vain conversation, and from the Curse of the Law; for it is certain, that God made satisfaction to none, nor can it be said, that satisfaction is made either to our iniquites, or our vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation, or to the Law.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I say this whole Plea is utterly removed by what hath been spoken: For 1. In what sence <hi>Redemption</hi> is ascribed to God and <hi>Moses,</hi> without the least prejudice of that <hi>proper</hi> redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was made by the blood of Christ, hath been declared, and shall be farther manifested, when we come to Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate the <hi>Price</hi> that was paid in this <hi>Redemption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, there is no Satisfaction made to our <hi>sinne,</hi> and <hi>vaine conversation,</hi> when we are redeemed: but Satisfaction being made to him to whom it is <hi>due,</hi> we are delivered from them. But of this afterwards.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Satisfaction is properly to the <hi>Law,</hi> when the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty which it threatens, and prescribes, is undergone, as in the case insisted on it was.

               </p>
               <p>Ans. A Lawfull Captive is detained two waies directly, and that two waies also, <hi>Legally, Juridically,</hi> and <hi>Authoritatively:</hi> so is sinfull Man detained Captive of God. The wrath of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bideth <hi>on him, Joh: 3. 36.</hi> as hath been declared.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Instrumentally,</hi> in subservience to the Authority of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So is Man in bondage to Sathan, and the Law, and feare of <hi>deathto come, Heb. 2. 14, 15.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Consequentially,</hi> and by accident; so a man is detained by his <hi>shackles,</hi> as in the <hi>filth</hi> of the Prison: so is a man Captive to Sinne, and the World; nor are all these <hi>properly</hi> the detainers of us in Captivity, from which we are redeemed, any more then the Gallowes keeps a Malefactor in Prison, from which by a Pardon and Ransome he is delivered.</p>
               <p>To proceed with the description of Redemption given; It<note place="margin">§. 23.</note> is the delivery of him who was captive from prison, or capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and all the miseries attending that condition.</p>
               <p n="1">1. What I meane by the Prison, is easily gathered from what hath been delivered concerning the Prisoner or Captive, and <hi>him</hi> that holds him captive. If the captive be a sinner as a sinner, and he who hold him captive be God, by his Justice making him lyable to Punishment, his captivity must needs be his <hi>obnoxiousnesse</hi> unto the wrath of God on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Justice for sin. This are we delivered from by this <hi>Redemption,</hi> that is in the blood of Jesus, <hi>Rom. 3. 23, 24, 25. For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God: Being justifyed freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Christ Iesus. Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through Faith in his blood, to declare his righteousnesse for the remission of sinnes tha are past, through the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of God.</hi> v. 23. is the description of the state of our Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity,

                  </gap>, by the Redemption or Ransome paying that is in the blood of Jesus; that is the cause of our deliverance from that condition wherein we were: whence and how it is so, is expressed <hi>v.</hi> 25. God sent him forth, for that end, that we might have deliverance through <hi>Faith in his blood,</hi> or by Faith be made partakers of the Redepmtion that is in his blood, or purchased by it: and this to <hi>declare his righteousnesse;</hi> we have it this way, that the Righteousnesse of God may be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, whereto Satisfaction is made by the death of Christ: for that also is included in the word, <hi>propitiation,</hi> as shall be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward proved.</p>
               <p>Thus whilst men are in this <hi>captivity,</hi> the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth<note place="margin">§. 24.</note> on them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 36. and the full accomplishment of the execution of that wrath is called the <hi>wrath to come, 1 Thes.</hi> 1. 10. which we are delivered from.</p>
               <p>In this sence are we said to <hi>have Redemption Col.</hi> 1. 14. in his <hi>blood,</hi> or to have deliverance from our <hi>captivity</hi> by the price he paid; and by his <hi>death</hi> to be delivered from the feare of death <hi>Heb.</hi> 2 15. or our obnoxiousnesse thereto; it being the <hi>Justice</hi> or <hi>Judgement</hi> of God, that they which commit sinne, are worthy of death, Rom. 1. 32. Christ by undergoing it delivered us from it.</p>
               <p>Whence is that of the Apostle Rom 8. 33, 34. <hi>Who shall lay any thing to their charge, who shall condemne them?</hi> Who should but God? It is God against whom they have sinned, whose the Law is, and who alone can pronounce <hi>Sentence of Condemnation</hi> on the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, &amp; inflict <hi>penalty</hi> accordingly. Yea, but it is <hi>God that Justifies:</hi> that is, that frees men from their obnoxiousnesse to punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for sin in the first sence of it, which is their <hi>captivity,</hi> as hath been declared; but how comes this about? Why <hi>it is Christ that dyed,</hi> it is by the <hi>death</hi> of Christ that we have this Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

This redeeming us from our sinnes, respects two things. 1. The guilt of them that they should not condemn us; and 2. the power of them, that they should not rule in us: in the place mentioned, it is the latter that is principally intended, which is evident from what was opposed to the captivity under sinne that is spoken of; in the one place, it is <hi>Purchasing to himselfe a peculiar people zealous of good workes,</hi> Tit. 2. 14. in the other, <hi>the purifying of our soules in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the truth through the Spirit,</hi> v. 22. Now we are redeemed from the power of our sin, by the blood of Christ; not immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but consequentially; as a Captive is delivered frō his Fatters and Filth upon the payment of his Ransome; Christs satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Justice of God, reconciling him to us by his death, hath alsoprocured the <hi>gift of his Spirit</hi> for us, to deliver us from the <hi>power</hi> of our sinne.

               </p>
               <p>And the great plea of our Adversary, that this redemption is not proper, because we are <hi>redeemed from our iniquities, and vain conversation,</hi> to which no ransome can be payd, will then be <hi>freed</hi> from ridiculous folly, when they shall give an instance of a <hi>Ransome</hi> being paid to the Prisoners fetters before his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very; whereunto our sins do rather answer, then to the Judge.</p>
               <p>2. There is a Redeeming of us from the Guilt of sinne,<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> which hath a twofold expression. 1. Of redeeming us from the

                  <hi>Curse of the Law, Gal:</hi> 3. 13. And 2. Of the <hi>redemption of Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, Heb:</hi> 9. 15.</p>
               <p>For the First, the <hi>Curse of the Law,</hi> is the <hi>Curse due to sinne, Deut.</hi> 27. 29. that is, to the transgression of the Law. This may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered two wayes: 1. In respect of its <hi>rise</hi> &amp; <hi>fountaine,</hi> or its <hi>terminus a quo.</hi> 2.

               <p>For the First; Or the <hi>Rise</hi> of it; it is the Justice of God, or the just and <hi>Holy Will</hi> of God, requiring punishment for sinne; as the <hi>vengeance</hi> that is inflicted actually for sinne, is called the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, <hi>Rom:</hi> 1. 18. that is, his <hi>Justice</hi> and indignation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne.

                  </hi> pid into the hand of any. For instance; If a Father be held <hi>captive,</hi> and he that holds him so, requires that for the delivery of his Father, the Sone undertake a difficult and hazardous Warfare, wherein he is concerned; &amp; he do it accordingly; this Sonne doth properly <hi>ransome</hi> his Father, though no <hi>reall</hi> price be paid into the hand of him that detained him.

And the price paid by Christ could be no other. For God was not our detainer in Captivity as a <hi>Soveraigne Conquerour,</hi> that came upon us by force and kept us Prisoners, but as a <hi>just Judge</hi> and <hi>Lawgiver,</hi> who had seized on us for our Transgressions. So hat not his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Will</hi> was to be treated withall, but his Law and Justice, and so the Ransome was properly paid to him, in the undergoing that <hi>penalty</hi> which his Justice required.</p>

               <p n="4">4. There are two things distinctly in God to be considered<note place="margin">§. 36.</note> in this businesse.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Love, his will, or purpose. 2. His Justice, Law, and Truth. In respect of his Love, his will his purpose, or good-pleasure, God himselfe found out, appointed, and provided this Ransome. The giving of Christ is ascribed to his Love, Will, and good pleasure, <hi>Ioh. 3. 16. Rom.</hi> 5. 8 &amp; 8. 32. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 9, 10. as he had promised by his <hi>Prophets</hi> of old, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 67. But his Law
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:115372:334"/> and Truth &amp; Justice in their Severall considerations, reuired the <hi>Ransome,</hi> and in respect of them he accepted it, as hath been shewed at large: So that nothing in the world is more <hi>vaine,</hi> then that of our Adversaries; that God procured and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this price, therefore he did not accept it: That is, either Gods Love or his Justice must be denyed. Either he hath no <hi>justice</hi> against sinne, or <hi>no Love</hi> for sinners; in the Reconciliation of which two, the greatest and most intense <hi>hatred</hi> against sinne, &amp; the most <hi>vnexpressible</hi> Love to some sinners in the blood of his only Sonne, lyes the <hi>great mistery</hi> of the Gospell, which these men are unacquainted withall.</p>
               <p n="5">5. That God may be said to receive this <hi>Price,</hi> it was not<note place="margin">§. 37.</note> necessary that any <hi>Accession</hi> should be made to his Riches by the <hi>Ransome,</hi> but that he underwent no losse <hi>by our deliverance.</hi> This is the difference between a <hi>Conquerour</hi> or a <hi>Tyrant</hi> and a just Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, in respect of their Captives, and Prisoners. Sayes the <hi>Tyrant</hi> or Conquerour, <hi>pay me so much</hi> whereby I may be <hi>enriched</hi> or I will not part with my Prisoner: Says the just Ruler and Judge, <hi>take care that my justice be not injred;</hi> that <hi>my Law be satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,</hi> and I will deliver the prisoners. It is enough to make good Gods acceptance of the Price, that this Justice suffered not by the delivery of the Prisoner; as it did not <hi>Rom. 3. 25.</hi> yea it was exalted and made glorious above all that it could have been, in the <hi>everlasting destruction</hi> of the sinner.</p>
               <p>These things being thus premised, it will not be difficult to<note place="margin">§. 38.</note> establish the Truth asserted; namely, that this <hi>Price</hi> or <hi>Ransome</hi> was paid to God. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. A <hi>Price</hi> of Redemption, a <hi>Ransome</hi> must be paid to some or other: The nature of the thing requires it. That the death of Christ was a <hi>price</hi> or Ransome properly so called, hath been shewed before; the ridiculous Objection, that then it must be payd to Sathan or our sinne, hath also been sufficiently remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, so that God alone remaines to whom it is to be paid. For unlesse to some it is paid, it is not a Price or Ransome.</p>

The <hi>Price</hi> of Redemption is to be paid to him who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines<note place="margin">§. 39.</note> the Captive by way of Jurisdiction, Right, and Law Power.

               <p>For the farther confirmation of what hath been delivered,<note place="margin">§. 43.</note> some few of the most eminent Testimonies given to this truth, are to be explained and vindicated, wherewith I shall close this Discourse of our Redemption by Christ. Out of the very

                  <q>Christ by his obedience (especially in
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:115372:337"/> his death) and the prayers accompanying it, obtained this of his Father, that he should not forsake and harden mankind, drenched in greivous sinnes, but should give them a way of coming to righteousnesse by Jesus Christ, and should deliver them from a necessity of dying in their sinne, by revealing a way whereby they might escape it.</q>

The <hi>Mercy seat</hi> declared God to be appeased; but how? by <hi>the blood of the Sacrifice that was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered</hi> without, and brought into the <hi>holy place;</hi> The High Priest never went into that place, <hi>about the worship of God,</hi> but it was with the <hi>blood of that Sacrifice,</hi> which was expresly appointed to <hi>make Attonement, Levit.</hi> 16. God would not have the <hi>Mercy seate</hi> once seen, nor any <hi>pledge</hi> of his being Attoned, but by the <hi>blood</hi> of the Propitiatory Sacrifice. So it is here, God sets out Jesus Christ as a <hi>propitiation; declares</hi> himselfe to be <hi>appeased</hi> adn <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled;</hi> but how? by the <hi>blood of Christ;</hi> by the <hi>sacrifice of himselfe,</hi> by the <hi>Price of Redemption</hi> which he paid. This is the intendment of the Apostle; Christ by his <hi>Blood,</hi> and the <hi>Price he paid</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, with the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> he made, having <hi>Attoned God,</hi> or made <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement</hi> with him for us, God now sets him forth, the Vaile of the Temple being Rent, to the <hi>eye</hi> of all <hi>Believers,</hi> as the <hi>Mercy seat</hi> wherein we may see God fully reconciled to us. And this may serve for the vindication of the Testimony to the Truth insisted on; and this is the same with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17.</p>
               <p>It would be too long for me to insist in particular, on the<note place="margin">§. 56.</note> full vindication of the other Testimonies, that are used for the confirmation of this Truth.

               <head type="sub">Of Reconciliation by the Death of Christ as it is a Sacrifice.</head>
               <p>THE next consideration of the Death of Christ, is of it as a <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> and the proper Effect thereof is <hi>Reconciliation</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> by his Death as a Sacrifice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Reconciliation in generall, is the <hi>renewall of lost friendship and peace between persons at variance.</hi> To apply this to the matter treated of, the ensuing positions are to be premised.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was at first in the state of <hi>innocency, friendship</hi> and peace between God and man. God had no enmity against his Creature: He approved him to be good: and appointed him to <hi>walke in peace, communion, confidence, and boldnesse</hi> with him. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Nor had man, on whose heart the Law and Love of his Maker was <hi>written,</hi> any enmity against his <hi>Creator, God,</hi> and <hi>Rewarder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. That by sinne there is <hi>division,</hi> separation and breach of <hi>peace</hi> and friendship introduced between God and the Creature; Isa. 59. 2. <hi>Your iniquities have separated between you and your God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 2.</note>
                  <hi>and your sinnes have hid his face from you,</hi> Isa. 63. 10. <hi>They rebelled against him, therefore he was turned to be their enemy and fought against them. There is no peace to the wicked saith my God.</hi> Is. 48 22. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that upon a delivery from this condition we are said (and not before) to <hi>have peace with God.</hi> Rom. 5. 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That by this <hi>breach of peace and friendship</hi> with God, God<note place="margin">§. 3.</note> was <hi>alienated</hi> from the sinner, so as to be angry with him, &amp; to renounce all peace and friendship with him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as such, and in that condition. He that <hi>believeth not, the wrath of God abides on him. Joh.</hi> 3. 36. And therefore by nature, and in our naturall condition, we are <hi>children of wrath</hi> Ep. 2. 3. that is, obnoxious to the wrath of God, that abides upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers; that is, unreconciled Persons.</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="611" facs="tcp:115372:339"/>4. This enmity on the part of God, consists</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the purity and holinesse of his nature, whence he<note place="margin">§. 4.</note> cannot admit a <hi>guilty defiled Creature</hi> to have any communion with him; He is a God of purer eyes then to behold iniquity. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 13. And <hi>sinners</hi> cannot serve him because he is an <hi>Holy God, a jealous God, that will not forgive their Transgressions nor their sinnes. Josh.</hi> 24. 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In his <hi>will</hi> of punishing for sinne, Rom. 1. 32. <hi>It is the Judgement of God that they which commit sinne are worthy of death;</hi> and this from the Righteousnesse of the thing it selfe 2 Thess. 1. 6. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulations</hi> to sinners: He is not a God that hath <hi>pleasure in iniquity,</hi> Psal. 5. 4, 5, 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the sentence of his Law, in the establishing and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution whereof his truth and honour were engaged, <hi>In the day thou eatest thou shalt dye,</hi> Gen. 2. 17. <hi>And cursed is every one that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth not &amp;c.</hi> Deut. 27. 29. And of this enmity of God against sinne and sinners, as I have elsewhere at large declared, there is an <hi>indelible</hi> perswasion abiding on the hearts of all the Sons of men, however by the <hi>stirrings</hi> of Lust and craft of Sathan, it may be more or lesse <hi>blotted</hi> in them. hence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As a <hi>fruit</hi> and evidence of this enmity, God abominates their persons, <hi>Psal. 1. 4, 5, 6. rejects</hi> and <hi>hates</hi> their <hi>dutyes</hi> and <hi>ways,</hi> Prov. 15. 8, 9. And prepares <hi>Wrath</hi> and Vengeance for them to be inflicted in his appointed time, Ro. 2. 5. All which make up <hi>perfect enmity</hi> on the part of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That man was at enmity with God as on his part, I<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> shall not need to prove; because I am not treating of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation</hi> to God, but of his Reconciliation to us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Where there is such an <hi>enmity</hi> as this, begun by <hi>offence</hi> on<note place="margin">§. 6.</note> the one part, and continued by anger and purpose to punish on the other, to make <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is properly to <hi>propitiate,</hi> and <hi>turne</hi> away the Anger of the person offended, and thereby to <hi>bring</hi> the <hi>Offendor</hi> into favour with him againe, and to an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the <hi>same,</hi> or a friendship built on better conditions then the former. This description of <hi>Reconciliation</hi> doth God himselfe give us, <hi>Job. 42. 7, 8, 9. And it was so, that after the Lord had spoken these words unto Job, the Lord said to Eliphaz the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manite, my wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my Servant Job
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:115372:340"/> hath. Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven Rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for your selves a burnt offering, and my Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant Job shall pray for you, for him will I accept, least I deale with you after your folly, in that you have not spoken of me the thing that is right, like my servant Job, &amp;c</hi> The <hi>offenders</hi> are <hi>Eliphaz</hi> and his two <hi>Friends:</hi> The <hi>offence</hi> is their <hi>folly in not speaking aright of God:</hi> The issue of the breach is, that the <hi>wrath or anger of God was towards them;</hi> Reconciliation is the turning away of that wrath; the <hi>meanes</hi> wherby this was to be done, appointed of God; is the <hi>Sacrifice of Job,</hi> for Attonement.</p>
               <p>This then is that which we ascribe to the Death of Christ,<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> when we say that as a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> we were <hi>reconciled</hi> to God by it; or that he made <hi>reconciliation</hi> for us. Having made God our <hi>enemy</hi> by sinne (as before) Christ by his death turned away his <hi>Anger,</hi> appeased his <hi>wrath,</hi> and brought us into favour againe with God: Before the proof of this, I must needs give one cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to some <hi>termes</hi> of this Discourse, as also remove an <hi>objection</hi> that lyes at the very entrance against the whole nature of that which is treated of.</p>
               <p>For the first, when we speake of the Anger of God, his wrath<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> and his being appeased toward us, we speake after the <hi>manner of men,</hi> but yet by the allowance of God himselfe; not that God is properly <hi>angry,</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> altered from that state and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased, whereby he should properly be <hi>mutable</hi> and be <hi>actually</hi> changed; but by the <hi>Anger</hi> of God, which sometime in Scripture signifyeth his <hi>Justice</hi> from whence punishment proceeds, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the effects of anger or punishment, itself, the obstacles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned on the part of God, from his <hi>nature, Justice, Law,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> are intended▪ and his being appeased toward us, his being satisfyed as to all the <hi>barrs</hi> so laid in the way from <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving</hi> us to <hi>favour,</hi> without the <hi>least</hi> alteration in him, his <hi>nature, will,</hi> or <hi>Justice:</hi> &amp; according to the <hi>analogie</hi> hereof, I desire that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is spoken of the <hi>Anger</hi> of God, &amp; his being <hi>appeased</hi> or altered which is the language wherein he converseth with us, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structs us to wisdome, may be <hi>measured</hi> and interpreted.</p>

                  <q>If this be the chiefest and highest love of God, that he sent Christ his only Sonne to be a propitiation for our sinnes, how then could Christ by his death appease the wrath of God, that was incensed against us? For seeing that Gods love was the cause of sending Christ, he must needs before that have laid aside his anger: for otherwise should he not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensely love us, and not love us at the same time? And if God could then be angry with us, when he gave up his Sonne to bitter death for our everlasting happinesse, what Argument or evidence at any time can we have from the effect of it, whence we may know, that God is not farther angry with us?</q>

               <p>Before I produce our witnesses in this cause, I must give this<note place="margin">§. 13.</note> one caution: It is not said any where <hi>expresly,</hi> that <hi>God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to us,</hi> but that we are <hi>reconciled</hi> to God. And the <hi>sole reason</hi> thereof is, because he is the <hi>party offended,</hi> and we are the <hi>parties offending;</hi> now the partie offending, is alwaies said to be <hi>reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the party offended,</hi> and not on the contrary; so <hi>Math. 5. 23, 24. If thy Brother have ought against thee, go and be reconciled to him;</hi> The Brother <hi>being the party offended,</hi> he that <hi>had offended,</hi> was to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi> to him by turning away his anger: and in <hi>common speech,</hi> when one hath <hi>justly provoked</hi> another, we bid him, <hi>goe,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile himselfe</hi> to him, that is, <hi>do that</hi> which may <hi>appease</hi> him, and give an entrance into his favour again; so is it in the <hi>Case</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der consideration; being the parties <hi>offending,</hi> we are said to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to God, when his anger is <hi>turned away,</hi> and we are <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> into his favour. Let now the Testimonies speak for themselves.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It appears from the Relation that this <hi>expression</hi> bears to that of v. 8. <hi>whilest we were yet sinners Christ died for us;</hi> with which this upon the matter is the same, we <hi>are reconciled to God by the death of his Sonne:</hi> Now the intent of this expression, <hi>Christ died for us sinners,</hi> is, He dyed to bring <hi>us sinners</hi> into the favour of God; nor will it admit of any other sence; so is <hi>our being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled</hi>
                  <pb n="616" facs="tcp:115372:342"/> to God by the Death of his Sonne: And that this is the meaning of the Expression, <hi>Christ died for us,</hi> is evident from the illustration given to it by the Apostle, v. 6, 7. <hi>Christ died for the ungodly,</hi> How? as <hi>one man</hi> dyeth for another; that is, to deliver him from death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the description of the same thing in other words<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> v. 9. <hi>being justifyed by his blood:</hi> that it is the same thing upon the matter that is here intended, appeares from the <hi>contexture</hi> of the Apostles speech, <hi>Whilest we were yet enemyes Christ dyed for us; much more being Justifyed by his blood.</hi> And <hi>if when when we were enemies we were reconciled to God;</hi> the Apostle repeats what he had said before; <hi>if when we were enemies Christ dyed for us,</hi> and <hi>we were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifyed by the blood of Christ,</hi> that is, <hi>if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God?</hi> Now to be <hi>justifyed, is Gods Reconciliation to us,</hi> his Acceptation of us into favour, not our <hi>Conversion</hi> to him, as is known and confessed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reconciliation we <hi>have with God,</hi> is a thing <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>we have received the reconciliation or Attonement:</hi> Now this cannot be spoken in reference to our Reconciliation to God, as on our side, but of his to us, and our acceptation with him: Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to God is our Conversion: but we are not said to <hi>receive our Conversion,</hi> or to have our <hi>Conversion</hi> tendred to us; but to Convert our selves, or to be Converted.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The state and condition from whence we are delivered<note place="margin">§. 17.</note> by this Reconciliation, is described in this, that we are called Enemies, <hi>being enemies we were reconciled.</hi> Now Enemyes in this place are the same with Sinners. And the Reconciliation of Sinners, that is, of those who had rebelled against God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him, were obnoxious to wrath, is certainely the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the <hi>favour</hi> of God for them. When you say, such a poore <hi>conquered Rebell,</hi> that expected to be tortured and slaine, is by means of such an one reconciled to his prince; what is it that you intend? Is it that he begins to <hi>like</hi> and <hi>love</hi> his <hi>Prince</hi> only, or that his <hi>Prince</hi> lays down his wrath and pardons him?</p>
               <p n="5">5. All the considerations before insisted on, declaring in what sence we are saved by the death of Christ, prove our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with God, to be our Acceptation with him, not our Conversion to him.</p>
               <pb n="617" facs="tcp:115372:342"/>
               <p>2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 18, 19, 20, 21. Is a place of the same importance<note place="margin">§. 18.</note> with that obove mentioned, wherein the <hi>Reconciliation</hi> pleaded for, is asserted, and the nature of it explained. <hi>And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himselfe by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of Reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Christ Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling the world to himselfe, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and hath committed unto us the word of Reconciliation. Now then we are Ambassadors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christs steed be ye reconciled to God. For he hath made him to be sinne for us, who knew no sin, that we might be made the Righteousnesse of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is in the words a twofold <hi>Reconciliation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of God to man <hi>v. 18. God hath Reconciled us to himselfe by Iesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Our <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God, in the <hi>Acceptance</hi> of that <hi>recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,</hi> which we are exhorted to.</p>
               <p>The first is that enquired after; the Reconciliation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the anger of God by Christ is turned away, and those for whom he dyed are brought into his favour; which comprises the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> proposed to confirmation. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. Unlesse it be that God is so Reconciled and Attoned,<note place="margin">§. 19.</note> whence is it that he is thus proclaimed to be a <hi>Father</hi> towards sinners as he is here expressed? Out of Christ he is a <hi>consuming</hi> fire to sinners, and <hi>everlasting burnings,</hi> Is. 33. 14. <hi>Being of purer eyes then to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab 1. 13. <hi>Before whom no sinner shall appeare or stand,</hi> Ps. 5. 4, 5. So that where there is no Sacrifice for sinne, there <hi>remaines nothing to Sinners, but a certaine fearefull looking for of judgement, and fiery indignation that shall consume the Adversaries,</hi> Heb. 10, 26, 27. How comes then this <hi>jealous</hi> God, this <hi>Holy</hi> God, and <hi>just Iudge,</hi> to command <hi>some</hi> to Beseech <hi>Sinners,</hi> to be reconciled to him? the reason is given before. It is because he <hi>reconciles</hi> us to himselfe by Christ, or in Christ: That is by Christ His <hi>Anger</hi> is <hi>Pacifyed,</hi> His <hi>Iustice Satisfyed,</hi> and himselfe appeased, or Reconciled to us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Reconciliation mentioned, is so expounded in the<note place="margin">§. 20.</note> Cause and Effect of it, as not to admit of any other interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Effect</hi> of Gods being <hi>reconciled,</hi> or his reconciling the world to himself, is in those words; <hi>Not imputing to them their tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes.</hi>
                  <pb n="618" facs="tcp:115372:343"/> God doth so Reconcile us to himselfe by Christ, as not to impute our trespasses to us. That is, not dealing with us according as Justice required for our sinnes upon the account of Christs Remitting the penalty due to them; laying away his <hi>Anger,</hi> and receiving us to favour. This is the immediate fruit of the Reconciliation spoken of: If not the Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its selfe, <hi>non-imputation of sinne,</hi> is not our Conversion to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The cause of it is expressed <hi>v. 21. He made him to be sinne</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 21.</note>
                  <hi>for us, who knew no sinne.</hi> How comes it to passe that God the <hi>righteous Judge</hi> doth thus reconcile us to himselfe, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to us our sinnes? It is because he hath made Christ so be sinne for us; That is, either a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for sinne, or as sinne, by the <hi>imputation</hi> of our sinne to him. He was <hi>made sinne</hi> for us, as we are made the <hi>Righteousnesse of God in him.</hi> Now we are made the Righteousnesse of God by the imputation of his Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to us. So was he made sinne for us by the imputation of our sinne to him. Now for God to <hi>Reconcile us to himselfe</hi> by <hi>imputing</hi> our sinne to Christ, and thereon <hi>not imputing</hi> them to us, can be nothing but his being <hi>appeased</hi> and <hi>attoned</hi> towards us, with his receiving us to his favour, by and upon the account of the death of Christ.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This <hi>Reconciling</hi> of us to himself, is the Matter committed<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> to the Preachers of the Gospell, whereby, or by the declaration whereof, they should perswade us to be reconciled to God. He hath commited to us, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; this Doctrine concerning Reconciliation mentioned; <hi>We therefore beseech you to be reconciled to God.</hi> That which is the matter whereby we are perswaded to be reconciled to God, cannot be our Conversion it selfe, as is pretended. The Preachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell are to declare this word of God, <hi>viz. that he hath reconciled us to himselfe,</hi> by the blood of Christ, the blood of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament that was shed for us, and thereon perswade us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the tidings, or the subject of them, and to be at Peace with God. Can the sence be, we are <hi>converted</hi> to God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ye <hi>converted.</hi> This Testimony then speakes clearely to the matter under debate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The next place of the same import is, Eph. 2. 12, 13. 14,<note place="margin">§. 22.</note> 15, 16. <hi>That at hat time ye were without Christ, being aliens from the</hi>
                  <pb n="619" facs="tcp:115372:343"/>
                  <hi>commonwealth of Israel, &amp; strangers from the Covenant of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. But now in Christ Jesus ye who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were farre off, are made nigh by the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and hath broken down the middle wall of partition between us. Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the Law of commandements contained in Ordinances, for to make in himselfe of twaine one new man, so making peace. And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the Crosse having slaine the enmity thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is mention of a twofold Enmity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto God.<note place="margin">§. 23.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> among themselves.</p>
               <p>Of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> unto God, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Consider them as they are there described, and their Enmity to God is sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. And what in that estate was the respect of God unto them? What is it towards such persons as there described? The wrath of God <hi>abideth on them,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. they are <hi>children of wrath,</hi> Eph. 2. 3. So are they there expressly called: He hateth all the <hi>workers of iniquity,</hi> Psal. 5. 5. And will by no meanes <hi>acquit the guilty,</hi> Exod. 34. 7. Yea he <hi>curseth those families that call not on his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> among themselves: which is expressed, both in the thing it selfe, and in the cause of it; It is called Enmity, and said to arise from, or be occasioned, and improved by the Law of Commandements contained in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; The occasion, improvement, and management of this Enmity between them, see elsewhere.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here is mention of a twofold Reconciliation.<note place="margin">§. 24.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> among themselves, <hi>v. 14, 15. He is our peace, and hath made both one, slaying the enmity, so making peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Of <hi>both unto God,</hi> v. 16. <hi>that he might reconcile both unto God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The manner whereby this Reconciliation was wrought; in his <hi>body by the Crosse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reconciliation unto God is that aymed at: This Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is the reconciling of God unto us, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the blood of Christ, as hath been declared. The bringing of us into his favour, by the laying away of his wrath and enmity against us: Which appeares</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="620" facs="tcp:115372:344"/>1. From the cause of it expressed: that is, the <hi>Body</hi> of Christ,<note place="margin">§. 25.</note> by the <hi>Crosse;</hi> or the death of Christ. Now the Death of Christ was immediately for the Forgivenesse of sins. <hi>This is the blood of the new Testament that was shed for many for the forgivenes of sins.</hi> It is <hi>by shedding</hi> of his <hi>blood,</hi> that we have <hi>remission</hi> or <hi>forgivenes.</hi> That this is by an Attoning of God, or our acceptance into favour, is confessed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. From the expression it selfe: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <note place="margin">§. 26.</note> denotes one party in the businesse of Reconciliation He made peace between them both; between the <hi>Gentiles</hi> on the one hand, and the <hi>Iewes</hi> on the other; and he made peace between them both, and God; <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>God</hi> on the other: So that God is a party in the businesse of Reconciliation, and is therein reconciled to us: for our reconciliation to him, is mentioned in our Reconciliation <hi>together,</hi> which cannot be done without our <hi>Conversion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. From the description of the enmity given <hi>v.</hi> 12. which<note place="margin">§. 27.</note> plainely shews, (as was manifested) that it was on both sides. Now this Reconciliation unto God is by the removall of that Enmity. And if so, God was thereby reconciled, and <hi>attoned,</hi> if he hath any Anger or Indignation against sinne, or sinners.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because this Reconciliation of both of God, is the great<note place="margin">§. 28.</note> cause and meanes of their Reconciliation among themselves. God through the blood of Christ, or on the account of his death, receiving <hi>both</hi> into favour, their mutuall enmity <hi>ceased,</hi> and without it never did, nor ever will. And this is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation accomplished by Christ.</p>
               <p>The same might be said of the other places, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 20, 21. But<note place="margin">§. 29.</note> I shall not need to multiply Testimonyes to the same purpose. Thus we have Reconciliation by Christ, in that he hath made Attonement or Satisfaction for our sinnes. The observations given on these Texts, being suited to <hi>obviate</hi> the Exceptions of <hi>Socinus</hi> treating of this <hi>subject,</hi> in his book <hi>de Servatore,</hi> without troubling the Reader with the Repetition of his words.</p>
               <p>That which in the next place I thought to do, is to prove that<note place="margin">§. 30.</note> we have this <hi>Reconciliation</hi> by the death of Christ as a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> But because I cannot do this to my own Satisfaction, without insisting first, on the whole Doctrine of <hi>Sacrifices</hi> in generall.
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:115372:344"/> Secondly, on the <hi>institution,</hi> Nature, End, and Efficacy of the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> of the <hi>Aaronicall</hi> Priesthod. Thirdly, the respect and Relation that was between them, and the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Christ, both in generall and in particular: And from all these consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations at large deducing the Conclusion proposed: And finding that this procedure would draw out this Treatise to a length, utterly beyond my expectation, I shall not proceed in it; but referre it to a peculiar discourse on that subject.</p>
               <p>That which I proposed to confirmation at the entrance of<note place="margin">§. 31.</note> this <hi>Discourse,</hi> was the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> made by the blood of Christ. This being proposed under severall considerations hath thus farre been severally handled: That his death was a <hi>Price,</hi> that we have <hi>Redemption</hi> thereby properly so called, was first evinced. That truth standing, the Satisfaction of Christ is sufficiently established, our Adversarys themselves being Judges. The <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that he offered in his death hath also been manifested. Hereof is the Reconciliation now delivered, the Fruit, and Effect. This also is no lesse destructive of the designe of these men: what they have to <hi>object</hi> against that which hath been spoken, shall have the next place in our Discourse.</p>
               <p>Thus then our <hi>Catechists</hi> to this businesse, in the 31, and 32,<note place="margin">§. 32.</note> Questions of the 8 Chap. which is about the Death of Christ.</p>

Because it is evident in the Scripture, that God reconciled us to himselfe, which evinceth the opinion of the Adversaries, to be altogether false, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 18. Col.</hi> 1. 20, 22.</q>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. Whether there be any mention of such a Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, as whereby the Anger of God is turned away, and we
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:115372:345"/> Received into Favour, in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the Reader will judge, from what hath been already proposed, and thither we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale. It is not about <hi>words and syllables</hi> that we contend, but <hi>things</hi> themselves. The <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of God to us, by Christ, is so expressed, as the Reconciliation of a Judge to an Offender, of a King to a Rebell, may be expressed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If Christ made Reconciliation for us, and for our sins an Attonement, he made the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for us, which we plead for.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is true; God is said <hi>to reconcile us</hi> to himselfe, but alwaies by <hi>Christ,</hi> by the <hi>blood of Christ:</hi> proposing himselfe as reconciled thereby, and declaring to us the Attonement; that we may turne unto him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. <q>That Jesus Christ shewed a way to us, who by Reason of our sinnes, were enemies to God, and Alienated from him, how we ought to turne unto God, and by that meanes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to him.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> I suppose there was never a more <hi>perverse</hi> description of <note place="margin">§. 35.</note> any <hi>thing,</hi> Part, or Parcell of the <hi>Gospell,</hi> by any <hi>Men</hi> fixed on. Some of the <hi>Excellencies</hi> of it may be pointed out.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Here is a <hi>Reconciliation</hi> between <hi>two</hi> parties, and yet a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation but of <hi>one;</hi> the other excluded.</p>
               <p n="2">2. An Enmity on <hi>one</hi> side only, between God and Sinners, is supposed, and that on the part of the Sinners; when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> do much more abound in setting out the <hi>Enmity</hi> of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them as such; his <hi>wrath abiding on them,</hi> as some will find one day to their eternall sorrow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Reconciliation is made nothing but Conversion, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version to God; which yet are <hi>termes</hi> and <hi>things,</hi> in the Scriptures every where distinguished.</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are said to be <hi>Enemies</hi> to God, <hi>propter peccata nostra,</hi> when the Scripture saies every where, that <hi>God is an Enemy to us, propter</hi>

                  <hi>peccata nostra.</hi> He hateth and is Angry with sinners, <hi>his judgement is that they which commit sinne, are worthy of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Here is no mention of the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ, which
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:115372:345"/> in every place in the whole Scripture, where this Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is spoken of, is expresly laid downe as the <hi>Cause</hi> of it; and necessarily denotes the Reconciliation of God to us, by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of his Anger, as the Effect of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Did Christ by his Death <hi>shew us a way,</hi> whereby we might <note place="margin">§. 36.</note> come to be reconciled to God or convert our selves? What was that way? Is it, that God lays <hi>punishment,</hi> and Affliction, and Death on them, who are no way <hi>liable</hi> thereunto? What else can we learne from the Death of Christ, according to these men? The truth is, they mention not his Death, because they know not how to make their ends hang together.</p>
               <p>This is the summe of what they say; We are <hi>Reconciled to God,</hi> that is, we <hi>Convert</hi> our selves; by the <hi>Death of Christ,</hi> that is, not <hi>by his death,</hi> but according to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> he Teacheth; and this is the summe of the Doctrine of Reconciliation, Christ <hi>teacheth us a way, how we should convert our selves to God.</hi> And so much for Reconciliation.</p>

                  <hi>Ans.</hi>
                  <q>None at all. As for that which Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians commonly think, that Christ by his Death, merited salvation for us, and satisfied fully for our sinnes, that opinion is false (or deceitfull) erroneous, and very pernitious.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That the <hi>men</hi> of this perswasion are <hi>bold</hi> men, we are not now to learne; Only this Assertion, that there is <hi>no other cause</hi> of the Death of Christ, but what they have mentioned, is a new <hi>experiment</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>If we must believe, that these men know <hi>all things,</hi> and the <hi>whole mind</hi> of God, so that all is <hi>false and pernitious,</hi> that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their <hi>roade</hi> and <hi>understanding,</hi> there may be some colour for this <hi>Confidence.</hi> But the Account we have already taken of them, will not allow us to grant them this plea.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Of the <hi>Merit</hi> of Christ, I have spoken briefly before. His <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>
                  <hi>Satisfaction</hi> is the thing opposed chiefely; What they have to say against it, shall now be considered.

               </p>
               <p>For the truth of this suggestion, that it is not extant in Scripture, I referre the Reader to what hath been discoursed from the Scripture about it already; When they, or any for them, shall answer, or evade the Testimonies that have been produced, or may yet be so, (for I have yet mentioned none
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:115372:346"/> of those which <hi>immediately</hi> expresse the <hi>dying</hi> of Christ for us, nor his being our Mediator and Surety in his death) they shall have liberty (for me) to boast in this manner. In the meane time we are not concerned in their wretched confidence. But let us see how they make good their Assertion by instances.</p>

Or is it that God so loved us, that he gave his only <hi>Sonne</hi> to dye for us, or that Christ loved us, and washed us in his own blood? Or is it that God for Christs sake doth <hi>freely</hi> forgive us? Yea but our Adversaries say, that God freely forgives us; yea but they say it is <hi>without</hi> Satisfaction. Is it then an <hi>encouragement</hi> to sinne, to affirme that God <hi>forgives us freely</hi> for the Satisfaction of his Sonne? and not to say, that he forgives us freely without Satisfaction? doth the adding of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> whereby God to the <hi>highest</hi> manifested his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrath against sinne; doth that I say make the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, &amp; give the Encouragement?

               <p>
                  <q>That these words [<hi>for us</hi>] do not signify in our place or stead, but for us, as the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressly speakes 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11. which also alike places do shew; where the Scripture saith, that Christ dyed for our sinnes, which word can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have this sence, that Christ dyed instead of our sinnes, but that he dyed for our sinnes, as it is expressly written <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 25. Moreover these words [<hi>Christ dyed for us</hi>] have this sence, that he therefore dyed, that we might imbrace and obtaine that eternall Salvation which he brought to us from Heaven, which how it is done you heard before.</q>

                  <hi>Resp.</hi> Briefely to state the difference between us about the <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> meaning of this expression [<hi>Christ dyed for us</hi>] I shall give one or two observations upon what they deliver, then confirme the <hi>common Faith,</hi> and remove their exceptions thereto.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Without any attempt of proofe they oppose <hi>vice nostri,</hi> and <hi>propter nos,</hi> as contrary &amp; inconsistent; &amp; make this their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that Christ did not dy <hi>vice nostri,</hi> because he dyed <hi>propter
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:115372:350"/> nos.</hi> When it is one Argument whereby we prove that Christ dyed in our stead, because he dyed <hi>for us,</hi> in the sence mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 11. where it is expressed by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, because we could no <hi>otherwise</hi> be brought to the end aymed at.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our sence of the expression is evident from what we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon, in the Doctrine in hand. Christ <hi>dyed for us,</hi> that is, he underwent the <hi>death and Curse that was due to us,</hi> that we might be delivered therefrom.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The last words of the <hi>Catechists</hi> are those wherein they <note place="margin">§. 20.</note> strive to hide the abomination of their <hi>hearts</hi> in reference to this businesse. I shall a little lay it open.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Christ say they, <hi>brought us eternall Salvation from Heaven;</hi> that is, <hi>he preached a Doctrine in obedience whereunto, we may obtaine Salvation.</hi> So did <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He dyed that we might receive it;</hi> that is, rather then he would <hi>deny the truth</hi> which he <hi>preached,</hi> he suffered himselfe to be put to death. So did <hi>Paul;</hi> and yet he was not <hi>Crucifyed for the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not indeed the <hi>death</hi> of Christ, but his <hi>Resurrection</hi> that hath an influence into our receiving of his Doctrine, &amp; so our obtaining Salvation. And this is the sence of these words, (<hi>Christ dyed for us.</hi>)</p>
               <p>For the confirmation of our Faith from this expression, <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> (<hi>Christ dyed for us.</hi>) we have</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>common sence,</hi> and customary usage of <hi>humane</hi> kind as to this expression.

And that supposall of <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 1. 11. of one daring to dye for a <hi>good man,</hi> relating (as by all Expositours on the place is evinced) to the practice of some in <hi>former dayes,</hi> who to deliver others from <hi>death,</hi> had given themselves up to <hi>that</hi> whereunto <hi>they</hi> were <hi>obnoxious,</hi> confirmes the same.</p>

                  <pb n="634" facs="tcp:115372:351"/> nor hath any intimation of undergoing that which was due to another, but only of being ready to the utmost to <hi>assist</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them. The same is the condition of what is affirmed of <hi>Paul;</hi> Of the <hi>measure of affliction,</hi> which in the <hi>infinite wise Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and Fatherly care of God, is proportioned to the <hi>mysticall</hi> body of Christ his Church, <hi>Paul</hi> underwent his share for the good of the whole. But that <hi>Paul,</hi> that any Believers were <hi>Crucified for the Church,</hi> or dyed for it, in the sence that <hi>Christ died for it,</hi> that they <hi>Redeemed</hi> it to God by their own blood, it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious blasphemy once to imagine. The meaning of the phrase (<hi>He died for our sinnes</hi>) was before explained. Christ then <hi>dying</hi> for us, being made <hi>sinne</hi> for us, <hi>bearing our iniquity,</hi> and redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us by his blood, <hi>died in our place and stead,</hi> and by his Death made satisfaction to God for our sinne.</p>

                  <q>Seeing it is read, that <hi>Moses</hi> was a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, <hi>Gal:</hi> 3. 19. (namely of the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant between God and the people of Israel) and it is evident, that he no way made satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to God; neither from hence, that Christ is the Mediator of God and man, can it be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly gathered, that he made any satisfaction to God for our sinne.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I shall take leave before I proceed, to make a returne of this Argument to <hi>them</hi> from whom it comes, by a meer change of the instance given. Christ they say, our High Priest, offered <hi>himselfe to God</hi> in heaven: Now <hi>Aaron</hi> is expresly said to be an <hi>High Priest,</hi> and yet he did not <hi>offer himselfe</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be certainly proved, that <hi>Christ</hi> offered himselfe in Heaven, because he was an <hi>High Priest.</hi> Or thus: <hi>David was a King, and a type of Christ;</hi> but <hi>David raigned at Jerusalem,</hi> and was a temporall King: It cannot therefore be proved, that
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:115372:351"/> Christ is a <hi>spirituall King</hi> from hence, that he is <hi>said to be a King.</hi> This Argument I confesse <hi>Faustus Socinus</hi> could not Answer when it was urged against him by <hi>Sidelius:</hi> But for the former, I doubt not but <hi>Smalcius</hi> would quickly have Answered, that it is true; it cannot be necessarily proved, that Christ Offereth himselfe in Heaven, because he was an <hi>High Priest,</hi> which <hi>Aaron</hi> was also, but because he was <hi>such an High Priest,</hi> as entred into the <hi>Heavens</hi> to appeare personally in the presence of God for us, as he is described to be. Untill he can give us a better An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to our Argument, I hope he will be content with this of <hi>ours</hi> to his. It is true, it doth not appeare, nor can be evinced necessarily, that Christ made <hi>satisfaction</hi> for us to God, because he was a <hi>Mediator</hi> in generall, for so <hi>Moses</hi> was who made no satisfaction; but because it is said, that he was <hi>such a Mediator</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> as gave his Life a <hi>Price of Redemption</hi> for them for whom with God he mediated, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 6. it is most evident and undeniable; and hereunto <hi>Smalcius</hi> is silent.</p>
               <p>What remaines of this Chapter in the <hi>Catechists,</hi> hath been <note place="margin">§. 28.</note> already fully considered; so to <hi>them</hi> and M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> B. as to his 12<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Chapter about the death of Christ, what hath been said may suffice. Many weighty Considerations of the <hi>Death of Christ</hi> in this whole discourse, I confesse are omitted; and yet more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been <hi>delivered,</hi> then by our Adversaries occasion hath been administred unto. But this businesse is the very <hi>Center</hi> of the New Covenant, and cannot sufficiently be weighed. God assisting, a farther attempt will ere long be made, for the <hi>briefe stating</hi> all the severall concernements of it.</p>

The <hi>issue</hi> that lyes before them, who are commanded to draw <hi>nigh</hi> to God, is, not whether they are <hi>Elected</hi> or no, but whether they will <hi>believe</hi> or no; God having given them Eternall, and unchangeable Rules; <hi>He that Believes shall be saved, and he that believes not, shall be damned,</hi> though no mans name be written in the Scripture, he that <hi>believes</hi> hath the <hi>Faith</hi> of Gods veracity, to assure him, that he shall be saved.

               <p n="6">6.

Nor is this proposition, <hi>he that believes shall be saved,</hi> founded on the <hi>universality</hi> of Love pleaded for, but the Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the meanes, for the Accomplishment of what is therein Asserted▪ namely the <hi>blood of Christ, who</hi> is believed on.</p>
               <p>Now because <hi>M.

               <p>For the <hi>first,</hi> me thinks a little respect and Reverence to that <note place="margin">§. 10</note> Testimony of our Saviour, <hi>many are called, but few are chosen,</hi> might have detained this <hi>Gentleman</hi> from asserting with so much <hi>confidence,</hi> that the perswasion of Gods <hi>choosing but a few,</hi> is an <hi>obstruction</hi> of mens coming unto God. Though he looks upon our blessed Saviour, as a <hi>meer man,</hi> yet I hope, he takes
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:115372:353"/> him for a <hi>true man,</hi> and one that <hi>taught the way of God aright.</hi> But a little farther to cleare this matter.</p>

Those <hi>some,</hi> are <hi>some</hi> only, not <hi>All:</hi> and therefore as to the <hi>good</hi> intended, there is not an <hi>Ʋniversall Love</hi> in God, as to the <hi>objects</hi> of it, but such a <hi>distinguishing</hi> one as is spoken against. <hi>Eph. 1. 4, 5. According as hee hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the World, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in Love: having Predestinated us to the adoption of Children by Jesus Christ to himselfe, according to the good pleasure of his will.</hi> Here are <hi>some chosen,</hi> and consequently an intention of God concerning them, expressed; and this from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, or before the <hi>foundation of the World,</hi> and this to the <hi>Good of Holinesse, Adoption, Salvation;</hi> and this is <hi>only</hi> of <hi>some,</hi> and not of <hi>all</hi> the World, as the whole tenour of the Discourse being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to <hi>Believers,</hi> doth abundantly manifest.</p>
               <p>Rom. 8. 28, 29, 30. <hi>And we know, that all things work together for</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 12.</note>
                  <hi>good, to them that are the called according to his purpose. For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Sonne, that he might be the first borne amongst many brethren: Moreover, whom he did Predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</hi> The <hi>good</hi> here <hi>intended</hi> is <hi>Glory,</hi> that the Apostle closes withall; <hi>Whom he justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, them he also glorified.</hi> The <hi>meanes</hi> of that <hi>End,</hi> consists in <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> and <hi>justification:</hi> The persons to be made partakers of this end, are <hi>not all</hi> the world, but the <hi>called according to his purpose;</hi> the designation of them so distinguished, to the end expressed, is from the <hi>purpose, foreknowledge,</hi> and <hi>predestination</hi> of God, (that is) his everlasting intention. Were it another man, with whom we have to doe, I should wonder that it came into his mind, to <hi>deny</hi> this Eternall intention of God towards some for good; but nothing is strange from the <hi>Gentleman</hi> of our present contest. They are but <hi>some</hi> which are <hi>ordained to Eternall life, Acts</hi> 13. 48. but <hi>some,</hi> that are <hi>given to Christ, Ioh. 17. 6. A remnant according to Election, Rom</hi> 11. 5. one being <hi>chosen,</hi> when <hi>another</hi> was rejected, before <hi>they were borne, or had done either good or evill, that the purpose of God, according to Election might stand, Rom</hi> 9. 11, 12. and those who attaine salvation, are <hi>chosen</hi> thereunto, through <hi>sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Spirit, and beliefe of the truth, 2 Thes.</hi> 2. 13.

God from <hi>all Eternity,</hi> according to the <hi>purpose of his own will,</hi> or the purpose which is according to <hi>Election,</hi> hath chosen <hi>some,</hi> and appointed them to the <hi>obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>life</hi> and Salvation by Christ, to the prayse of his glorious Grace. For the <hi>number</hi> of these, be they <hi>few</hi> or <hi>more,</hi> in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison of the rest of the World, the Event doth manifest.</p>
               <p>Yet farther to evidence that this <hi>purpose</hi> of God, or <hi>intention</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 13.</note> spoken of, is <hi>peculiar</hi> and distinguishing, there is Expresse mention of <hi>another sort</hi> of men, who are <hi>not thus chosen,</hi> but lye under the <hi>purpose</hi> of God, as to a contrary Lot and condition <hi>The Lord hath made all things for himselfe, yea even the wicked for the day of evill.</hi> Prov. 16. 4.

               <p>Moreover in all eminent Effects and <hi>Fruits</hi> of Love, in all the <note place="margin">§. 14.</note> issues and wayes of it, for the good of, and towards the Sonnes of men, God abundantly manifests, that his <hi>Eternall Love,</hi> that regards the <hi>everlasting</hi> good of men, as it was before described, is <hi>peculiar,</hi> and not <hi>universally</hi> comprehensive of <hi>all,</hi> and every one of man-kind.</p>
               <p>In the pursuit of that Love, he gave his Sonne to dye; <hi>For God commendeth his Love to us, in that whilest we were yet sinners, Christ dyed for us,</hi> Rom. 5. 8. <hi>Here in is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Sonne to be the Propitiation for our sinnes, 1 Joh.</hi> 4. 10.

I pray for them, I pray not for the World, but for them which thou hast given me, thine they were, and thou gavest them me,</hi> v. 6. <hi>And for their sakes I sanctify my selfe,</hi> v. 17. Even as he had said before, that he came to give his life <hi>a ransome for many, Mat.</hi> 20. 28. which <hi>Paul</hi> afterwards abundantly confirmes, affirming, that God <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his Church with his own blood, Acts</hi> 20. 28. Not the <hi>world,</hi> as contradistinguished from his Church, <hi>nor absolutely,</hi> but his <hi>Church</hi> throughout the World: And to give us a clearer insight into his intendment, in naming the <hi>Church</hi> in this businesse, he tells us, they <hi>are Gods Elect</hi> whom he means, <hi>Rom. 8. 32, 33, 34. He that spared not his Sonne, but delivered him up to death for us all, how shall he not with him, freely give us all things? who shall lay any thing to the charg of Gods Elect? It is God that Justifieth: who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that dyed, yea rather that is risen againe, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us.</hi> They are the <hi>Elect</hi> for whom God gave his Sonne, and that out of his Love, which the Apostle eminently sets out <hi>v.</hi> 32. those <hi>to whom with his Sonne</hi> he gives <hi>all things,</hi> and who shall on that account never be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Farther</hi> to manifest, that this great <hi>fruit</hi> and <hi>effect</hi> of the <note place="margin">§. 15.</note> Love of God, which is extended to the <hi>whole object</hi> of that Love, was not universall. 1. The <hi>Promise</hi> of giving him was not <hi>so:</hi> God promised <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>all,</hi> for, and to whom he giveth him. The <hi>Lord God of Israel</hi> by him <hi>visited and redeemed</hi> his people, raising up a <hi>horne of Salvation</hi> for them in the house of his servant <hi>David,</hi> as he spake by the <hi>mouth of his holy Prophets, which have been since the world began,</hi> Luk. 1 68, 69, 70. In the very first <hi>promise</hi> of him, the <hi>seed</hi> of the <hi>Serpent</hi> (as are all Reprobate unbelievers) are <hi>exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> from any interest therein, Gen 3. 15. And it was renewed again, not to all the world, but to <hi>Abraham &amp; his seed</hi> Gen. 12. 2, 3. Act. 2. 39. Act. 3. 25. And for many Ages, the <hi>Promise</hi> was <hi>so</hi> apropriated to the <hi>seed of Abraham</hi> Rom. 9. 5▪ with some few, that joyned themselves to them, <hi>Is.</hi> 56. 3, 4, 5. that the people of God prayed for a <hi>curse</hi> on the residue of the world <hi>Jer.</hi> 10 25. as they which were <hi>strangers from the Covenant of promise,</hi> Eph. 2.
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:115372:355"/> 12. they belonged not to them, So that God made not a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise</hi> of Christ to the <hi>universality of mankind;</hi> which sufficeintly evinceth, that it was not from an <hi>universall,</hi> but a <hi>peculiar</hi> Love that he was given. Nor</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Christ was <hi>exhibited</hi> in the <hi>flesh,</hi> according to the <note place="margin">§. 16.</note>
                  <hi>promise,</hi> was he given to all, but to the <hi>Church, Is.</hi> 9. 6. neither <hi>really</hi> as to their good, nor <hi>ministerially</hi> for the <hi>promulgation</hi> of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to any, but to the <hi>Jewes.</hi> And therefore when he <hi>came to his own,</hi> though his <hi>own received him not,</hi> Joh 1. 11. yet as to the <hi>ministry</hi> which he was to accomplish, he professed he was not <hi>sent but to the lost sheep of Israel;</hi> and gives order to them whom he sent forth to preach in his own life time, not to go into the <hi>way of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, nor to enter into any City of the Samaritans,</hi> Mat. 10. 5 yea when he had <hi>been lifted up,</hi> to draw all men to him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 14. and <hi>chap.</hi> 12. 32. and being Ascended had broken down the <hi>partition wall,</hi> and tooke away all distinction of <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision</hi> and <hi>uncircumcision,</hi> having dyed not only for that <hi>nation of the Jewes</hi> (for the remnant of them according to the election of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.) but that he <hi>might gather together in one the Children of God</hi> that were scattered abroad <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 52. whence the <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage</hi> and <hi>expressions</hi> of the Scripture as to the <hi>people of God</hi> are changed, and in stead of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> they are expressed by the <hi>world</hi> Joh 3. 16. the <hi>whole world,</hi> 1 Joh. 2. 1, 2. and <hi>all men,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 6. in opposition to the <hi>Jews</hi> only, <hi>some</hi> of <hi>all sorts</hi> being now taken into Grace and favour with God; yet neither then doth he doe what did remaine, for the full administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Covenant of Grace towards all; namely, the pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fing out of his Spirit with efficacy of power to bring them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to subjection to <hi>him;</hi> but still carries on, (though in a greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and latitude) a worke of <hi>distinguishing Love, taking</hi> some and <hi>refusing</hi> others. So that being <hi>exalted, and made a Prince and a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> he gives not repentance to all the world, but to them whom he redeemed to God by his blood, out of every <hi>kindred and tongue</hi>

                  <hi>and people and Nation,</hi> Rev. 5. 9.</p>
               <p>It appears then, from the consideration of this <hi>first</hi> most eminent <hi>effect</hi> of the love of God, in all the concernements of it, that that <hi>Love,</hi> which is the foundation of all the grace and Glory, of all the Spirituall and Eternall good things, whereof the sonnes of men are made partakers, is not <hi>universall,</hi> but <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar</hi> and <hi>distinguishing.</hi>

               <pb n="643" facs="tcp:115372:355"/>
               <p>M. <hi>Biddle</hi> being to prove his former Assertion of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sallity of Gods Love, mentions sundry places, where God is <note place="margin">§. 18.</note> said to love the world, and to send his Sonne to be the <hi>Saviour of the world,</hi> Joh. 3. 16, 17. John 6. 33. John 4. 42. 1 John 4. 14. John 12, 46, 47. 1 John 2. 1, 2. The reason of which expression the Reader was before acquainted with. The benefits of the death of Christ being now no more to be <hi>confined</hi> to one <hi>Nation,</hi> but promiscuously to be imparted to the <hi>Children,</hi> that were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered abroad <hi>throughout the world</hi> in every <hi>kindred, tongue,</hi> and <hi>Nation</hi> under Heaven, the word, <hi>world,</hi> being used to signify men living in the <hi>world,</hi> sometimes <hi>more,</hi> sometimes <hi>fewer, seldome</hi> or never, <hi>All</hi> (unlesse a distribution of them into severall sorts compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive of the universality of mankind be subjoyned) that word is used to expresse them, who in the intention of God and Christ are to be made partakers of the benefits of his <hi>mediation.</hi> Men of all sorts throughout the world, being now admitted thereunto: as was before asserted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>benefit</hi> of <hi>Redemption</hi> being thus grounded upon the <note place="margin">§. 19.</note> principle of <hi>peculiar,</hi> not <hi>universall</hi> Love, whom doth God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale his will concerning it unto? and whom doth he call to the participation thereof? If it be equally provided for all, out of the same love, it is all the <hi>Reason in the world</hi> that all should <hi>equally</hi> be called to a participation thereof, or at least so be <hi>called,</hi> as to have it made known unto them. For a <hi>Physitian</hi> to pretend that he hath provided a <hi>Soveraigne Remedy</hi> for all the <hi>sick</hi> persons in a City, out of an <hi>equall Love</hi> that he beares to them all, and when he hath done, takes care that some few know of it, whereby they may come and be healed, but leaves the rest in utter ignorance of any such provision that he hath made, will he be thought to deale <hi>sincerely</hi> in the profession that he makes of doing of this, out of an <hi>equall</hi> love to them all? Now not only for the space of almost 4000 yeares did God suffer incomparably the greatest part of the whole world, to <hi>walke in their own ways, not calling them to repent</hi> Act. 14. 16. <hi>winking</hi> at that long time of their ignorance, wherein they worshiped <hi>stocks, stones,</hi> &amp; Divels; all that while making <hi>known his word unto Iacob his statutes and judgements unto Israel, not dealing so with any Nation,</hi> whereby they knew not his judgements, <hi>Psal.</hi> 147. 19, 20. So in the pursuit of his <hi>Eternal Love,</hi> calling a <hi>few,</hi> only in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:115372:356"/> leaving the <hi>bulk</hi> of mankind in sinne, without <hi>hope or God</hi> in the world, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 12. but even also since the giving out of a Commission and expresse command, not to confine the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Word, &amp; calling of men, to <hi>Iudaeah,</hi> but to go into all the world and to preach the Gospell to <hi>every Creature</hi> Mark. 16. 15. whereupon it is shortly after said, to be <hi>preached to every creature under Heaven,</hi> Col. 1. 22. the Apostle thereby <hi>warning every man and teaching every man, that they might present every man to Iesus Christ</hi> Col. 1. 28 namely, of all those to whom he came and <hi>preached,</hi> not the <hi>Iewes</hi> only, but of <hi>all sorts</hi> of men <hi>under Heaven,</hi> and that on this ground, that God would have <hi>all men to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and come to the knowledg of the truth</hi> 1 Tim 2. 3, 4. be they of what sort they will, <hi>Kings, Rulers, and all under authority;</hi> yet even to this very day, many whole Nations, great and numerous sit in darknesse and in the shaddow of death, having neither in their <hi>own</hi> dayes, nor in the dayes of their <hi>forefathers,</hi> ever been made partakers of the <hi>glorious Gospell</hi> of Jesus Christ, whereby alone <hi>life</hi> and immortality are brought to light, and men are made partakers of the love of God in them.

               <p n="4">4. Not then to insist on any other particular effects of the <note place="margin">§. 21.</note> Love of God, as <hi>Sanctification, Iustification, Glorification;</hi> this in generall may be affirmed, that there is not any one good thing
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:115372:356"/> whatsoever, that is proper and peculiar to the Covenant of Grace, but it proceeds from a distinguishing Love, and an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God towards some only therein.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is true, that God <hi>inviteth many</hi> to Repentance, and <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 22.</note>
                  <hi>inviteth</hi> them by the means of the word, which he affords them, to turne from their evill wayes, of whom all the <hi>individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als</hi> are not converted, as he dealt with the <hi>house of Israel</hi> (not all the world, but) those who had his <hi>word and ordinances</hi> Ezek. 18. 31, 32. affirming that it is not for his <hi>pleasure,</hi> but <hi>for their sinnes,</hi> that they dye; but that this manifests an <hi>universal</hi> Love in God in the way spoken of, or any thing more then the <hi>connexion of Repentance</hi> and Acceptation with God, with his legall Approbation of turning from sinne, there is no matter of proofe to evince.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Also, he is not <hi>willing</hi> that any should perish, but that <hi>all</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 23.</note> should come to Repentance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. even <hi>all</hi> those towards whom he exercises <hi>patience</hi> and long suffering for that end, (which, as the Apostle there informes, is to <hi>us ward</hi>) that is, to <hi>Believers</hi> of whom he is speaking. To them also it is said, that he doth not <hi>afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men, Lam.</hi> 3. 33. even <hi>his Church</hi> of which the Prophet is speaking: although this also may be extended to all; God never afflicting or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving men, but it is for some other Reason and cause, then meerly his own will; their destruction being of themselves. <hi>David</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed tells us, that the <hi>Lord is gratious, full of compassion, slow to anger and of great mercy, that the Lord is good to all and his tender mercyes are over all his workes</hi> Psal. 145. 8, 9. But he tells us withall, whom he intends by the <hi>all</hi> in this <hi>place,</hi> even the generation which <hi>prayse his workes and declare his mighty acts,</hi> v. 4. those who abundantly <hi>utter the memory</hi> of <hi>his great goodnesse, and sing of his Righteousnesse,</hi> v. 7. or his Saints, as he expressly calls them <hi>v.</hi> 10. The word he there mentions, is the word of the Kingdom of <hi>Christ</hi> over all, wherein the <hi>tender mercyes</hi> of God are spread abroad, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to them that do enjoy them. Not but that God is good to all, even to his whole Creation, in the many <hi>unspeakeable</hi> blessings of his providence, wherein he <hi>abounds towards</hi> them in <hi>all goodnesse,</hi> but that is not here intended. So that M. B. hath fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessly from these Texts of Scripture, endeavoured to prove an <hi>universallity</hi> of Love in God, inconsistent with his <hi>peculiar</hi> Love,
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:115372:357"/>
                  <hi>purpose</hi> and intention of doing good in the sence declared to some only.</p>
               <p>And thus have I briefely gone through this Chapter, and <hi>by</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 24.</note>
                  <hi>the way</hi> taken into Consideration <hi>all the Texts</hi> of Scripture, which he there wrests to confirme his figment, On the goodnesse of the Nature of God, of the Goodnesse and Love to all, which he shews in great variety, and severall degrees, in the <hi>dispensation of his Providence</hi> throughout the World, of this universall Love, and what it is in the sence of M. B. and his companions, of its <hi>inconsistency</hi> with the <hi>immutability, prescience, omnipotence, fidelity, love, mercy,</hi> and <hi>faithfulnesse</hi> of God, this being not a controversy peculiar to <hi>them,</hi> with whom in this <hi>Treatise</hi> I have to do, I shall not farther insist.</p>
               <p>As I have in the <hi>Preface</hi> to this Discourse given an account of <note place="margin">§. 25.</note> the Rise, and present state of <hi>Socinianisme,</hi> so I thought in this place to have given the Reader an account of the present state of the <hi>Controversy</hi> about Grace, and <hi>Free-will,</hi> and the <hi>Death of Christ,</hi> with especiall reference to the late management there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of amongst the <hi>Romanists,</hi> between the <hi>Molinists</hi> and <hi>Jesuits</hi> on the one side, with the <hi>Jansenians,</hi> or <hi>Bayans</hi> on the other; with the late <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> and <hi>Politicall transactions</hi> in <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Flanders,</hi> in reference thereunto, with an account of the Books lately written on the one side and the other, and my <hi>Thoughts</hi> of them; but finding this Treatise grown utterly beyond my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, I shall deferre the execution of that <hi>designe</hi> to some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opportunity, if God <hi>think good</hi> to continue my <hi>portion</hi> any longer in the land of the Living.</p>
               <p>The 14<seg rend="sup">th</seg> Chapter of the <hi>Catechist,</hi> is about the <hi>Resurrection of</hi>

                  <hi>Christ.</hi> What are the <hi>proper fruits</hi> of the Resurrection of Christ, and the benefits we receive thereby, and upon what account our <hi>Justification</hi> is ascribed thereto, whether as the <hi>great</hi> and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>confirmation</hi> of the doctrine he taught, or as the <hi>issue, pledge,</hi> and <hi>evidence</hi> of the Accomplishment of the work of our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by deat, it being impossible for him to be detained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, is not here discussed; that which the great designe of this Chapter appears to disprove, is, Christs <hi>raising</hi> himselfe by his <hi>own</hi> power: concerning which this is the Question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did Christ rise by his own power, yea did he raise himselfe at all? or</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 27.</note>
                  <hi>was he raised by the power of another? and did another raise him? What
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:115372:357"/> is the perpetuall tenour of the Scripture to this purpose?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In Answer hereunto, many Texts of Scripture are rehearsed, where it is said, that <hi>God raised him from the dead, and that he was raised by the power of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we have manifested, that M. B. is to come to another <hi>reckoning,</hi> before he can make any work of this Argument; <hi>God raised him,</hi> therefore he did not <hi>raise himselfe:</hi> When he hath proved that <hi>he is not God,</hi> let him freely make such an inference and conclusion as this: In the <hi>mean time,</hi> we say, because <hi>God raised him from the Dead,</hi> he raised himselfe; for he is <hi>God over all blessed for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. It is true, that Christ is said to be raised by God, taken <note place="margin">§. 28.</note>
                  <hi>personally</hi> for the <hi>Father,</hi> whose joynt Power, with his Own, as that also of the Spirit, was <hi>put forth</hi> in this work of raising <hi>Christ</hi> from the Dead. And for his own <hi>raising himselfe,</hi> if M. B. will believe him, this businesse will be put to a short issue: He tells us, that <hi>he laid down his life, that he might take it up againe, no man</hi> (saith he) <hi>taketh it from me, I have power to lay it downe of my selfe, and I have power to take it againe,</hi> Joh. 10. 17, 18. And speaking of the Temple of his Body, He bad the Jews <hi>destroy</hi> it, and, <hi>that he would raise it againe within three daies:</hi> which we believe he did, and if M. B. be otherwise minded, we cannot help it.</p>

               <p>THIS Chapter, for the <hi>Title</hi> and Subject of it, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire <note place="margin">§. 1.</note> a large &amp; serious consideration; But by M. <hi>Biddles</hi> loose procedure in this businesse, (whom only I shall now at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend) we are absolved from any strict inquiry into the whole Doctrine that is concerned herein. Some briefe Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon his Questions, and suiting of Answers to them, will be all that I shall go forth unto. His first is,</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>How many sorts of Iustification or Righteousnesse are there?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="648" facs="tcp:115372:358"/>
               <p>This Question supposeth <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> and <hi>Justification</hi> to be the same: which is a grosse notion for a <hi>Master of Arts.</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse is that which God requires of u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Justification is his Act concerning man, considered as vested or induced with that <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> which he requires: Righteousnesse is the <hi>Qualification</hi> of the person to be Justifyed; Justification the Act of him that Justifies. A mans <hi>legall honesty</hi> in his tryall, is not the sentence of the <hi>Judge</hi> pronouncing him so to be, to all ends and purposes of that honesty. But to his Question M. B. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers from <hi>Rom. 10. 5. the Righteousnesse which is of the Law,</hi> and <hi>Phil. 3. 9. The Righteousnesse which is of God by Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, there is this twofold Righteousnesse that men may <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> be partakers of, a Righteousnes consisting in <hi>exact, perfect</hi> &amp; <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi> obedience yeilded to the Law, which God required of man under the Covenant of workes, and the Righteousnesse which is of <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Faith,</hi> of which afterwards: Answerable hereunto there <hi>is,</hi> hath <hi>been,</hi> or may <hi>be,</hi> a twofold <hi>Justification:</hi> the one consisting in Gods <hi>declaration</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> who performes all that he requires in the Law, to be Just and Righteous, and his accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him according to the Promise of Life, which he annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the obedience, which of man he did require. And the other Answers that <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> which shall afterward be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed. Now though these two <hi>Righteousnesses</hi> agree in their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall end, which is Acceptation with God, and a reward from him, according to his Promise, yet in their own <hi>natures,</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and manner of attaining, they are altogether <hi>inconsistent</hi> &amp; destructive of each other; So that it is utterly impossible they should ever meet in and upon the same person.</p>
               <p>For the description of the <hi>first,</hi> M. B. gives it in answer to <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> this Question.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How is the Righteousnesse which is of the Law described?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Moses describeth the Righteousnesse which is of the Law, that the man that doth these things shall live by them,</hi> Rom. 10. 5.</p>
               <p>This description is full and compleat. <hi>The doing of the things of the Law,</hi> or all the things the law requireth, to this end that a man may live by them, or a <hi>keeping of the commandements</hi> that we <hi>may enter into life,</hi> make up this Righteousnesse of the Law. And whatsoever any man doth, or may do, that is required by the Law of God, (as <hi>believing,</hi> trusting in him, and the like,) to
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:115372:358"/> this end, that he may live thereby, that it may be his <hi>Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> towards God, that thereupon he may be Justifyed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to this Righteousnesse of the Law here described by <hi>Moses.</hi> I say whatever is performed by man in Obedience to any <hi>Law</hi> of God to this end, that a man may <hi>live thereby,</hi> and that it may be the mater of his <hi>Righteousnesse,</hi> it belongs to the Righteousnesse here described: and of this we may have some use, in the consideration of M. B's ensuing Queries. He addes, <note place="margin">§. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What speaketh the Righteousnesse which is of Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Ro. 10. 8, 9. <hi>The word is nigh thee even in thy mouth, and in thy heart, that is, the word which we preach, that if thou shalt confesse with thy mouth the Lord Iesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Object of Justifying Faith, namely, <hi>Iesus Christ as dying,</hi> and <hi>rising againe</hi> from the dead to the obtaining of <hi>Eternall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> and <hi>bringing</hi> in Everlasting righteousnesse, is in these words described. And this is that which the Righteousnesse of Faith is said to speake; because Christ dying and rising is our Righteousnesse. He is <hi>made</hi> so to us of God, and being under the consideration of his death, and Resurrection received of us by Faith, we are Justifyed.</p>
               <p>His next question is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the Iustification of a Believer is the Righteousnesse of Christ impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
                  <hi>to him, or is his own Faith counted for Righteousnesse?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. Rom. 4. 5. <hi>His Faith is counted for Righteousnesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What M. B. intends by Faith, and what by accounting of it for Righteousnesse, we know full well. The <hi>Iustification</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends by these expressions is the plaine old <hi>Pharisaicall</hi> Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and no other: as shall elsewhere be abundantly manifested. For the present, I shall only say, that M. <hi>Biddle</hi> doth most ignorantly oppose the <hi>imputing</hi> of the Righteousnesse of Christ to us, and the accounting of our Faith for Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, as inconsistent. It is the accounting of our Faith for Righteousnesse, and the Righteousnesse of workes that is opposed by the Apostle. The <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of Faith, and the <hi>Righteousnesse</hi> of Christ are every way one and the same; the one denoting that whereby we receive <hi>it,</hi> and are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of it, the <hi>other</hi> that which is <hi>received,</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are Justifyed. And indeed there is a perfect incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:115372:359"/> between the Apostles intention in this expression, <hi>to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifies the ungodly, his Faith is accounted to him for Righteousnesse,</hi> taken with his explication of it, that we are made <hi>partakers of the Righteousnesse of Christ by Faith,</hi> &amp; therein he is made <hi>Righteousnesse to them that believe,</hi> with M. B's interpretation of it, which is (as shall be farther manifested) <hi>to him that worketh and believes on him, that Justifies the righteous his obedience is his righteousnesse.</hi> But of this elswhere.</p>
               <p>The next Question and Answer is about <hi>Abraham</hi> and his <note place="margin">§. 7.</note>
                  <hi>Justification,</hi> which being but an <hi>instance</hi> exemplifying what was spoken before, I shall not need to insist thereon. Of his believing on God <hi>only,</hi> our believing <hi>on Christ,</hi> which is <hi>also</hi> mentioned, I have spoken already, and shall not trouble the Reader with repetition thereof.</p>
               <p>But he farther argues. <note place="margin">§. 8.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Doth not God justifie men because of the full price Christ payd to him in their stead, so that he abated nothing of his right, in that one drop of Christs blood was sufficient to satiisfy for a thousand worlds? if not, how are they Saved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans, <hi>Being Justifyed freely,</hi> Rom. 3. 24. Eph. 1. 17.</p>
               <p>That Christ did pay a full <hi>price,</hi> or <hi>ransome</hi> for us that he did <hi>stand in our stead,</hi> that he was not <hi>bated</hi> any jot of the penalty of the Law, that was due to sinners, that on this account we are fully acquitted, and that the <hi>forgivenesse of our sinnes</hi> is by the Redemption that is in his blood, hath been already fully and at large evinced; Let M. B. if he please, attempt to evert what hath been spoken to that purpose.</p>
               <p>The expression about <hi>one drop of Christs blood is a fancy,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination <note place="margin">§. 9.</note> of idle Monkes, men ignorant of the Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of God, and the whole nature of the <hi>mediation</hi> which our blessed Saviour undertook; wherein they have not the least communion. The close of the Chapter is?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Did not Christ merit Eternall life and purchase the kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 10.</note>
                  <hi>for us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>The gift of God is Eternall Life,</hi> Rom. 6. 23. <hi>It is your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers good pleasure to give you the Kingdome,</hi> Luk. 12. 32.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eternall life is the gift of God,</hi> in opposition to any <hi>merit of ours,</hi> and in respect of his designation of him, who is eternall Life, to be our Mediatour, and purchaser of it; yet that Christ did
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:115372:359"/> not therefore obtain by his blood, for us <hi>eternall Redemption</hi> Heb. 9. 12. that he did not purchase us to <hi>himselfe, Tit.</hi> 2. 14. or that the merit of Christ for us, and the <hi>free Grace</hi> of God unto us, are <hi>inconsistent,</hi> our <hi>Catechist</hi> attempts not to prove Of the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of Gods purpose, and good <hi>pleasure,</hi> mentioned <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. 32. with the Satisfaction and merit of the Mediatour, I have spoken also at large already.</p>
               <p>I have thus briefely passed through this Chapter, although is treateth of one of the most <hi>important</hi> heads of our <hi>Religion,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (the Lord assisting) I intend the full handling of the Doctrine opposed in it, in a just <hi>Treatise</hi> to that purpose.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of keeping the Commandements of God: And of Perfection of Obedience, how attaineable in this Life.</head>
               <p>THE Title of Chapter 16<seg rend="sup">th</seg> in our <hi>Catechist,</hi> is of <hi>Keeping</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>
                  <hi>the Commandements, and having an eye to the reward, of perfection in vertue and Godlinesse to be attained; and of departing from Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Faith.</hi> What the man hath to offer on these severall heads, shall be considered in order. His first Question is.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Are the Commandements Possible to be kept?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>His Commandements are not grievous,</hi> Joh. 5. 3. <hi>My yoake is easy, and my burthen light,</hi> Math: 11. 30.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I presume it is evident to every one, at the first view, that <note place="margin">§. 2.</note> there is very little relation between the <hi>Question</hi> and the <hi>Answer</hi> thereunto suggested. The <hi>inquiry</hi> is of our <hi>strength</hi> &amp; power: the <hi>Answer</hi> speaks to the <hi>nature</hi> of the Commands of God. It never came sure into the mind of any living, that the meaning of this Question, <hi>Are the Commandements possible to be kept?</hi> Is, <hi>is there an absolute impossibility from the nature of the Commands of God themselves that they cannot be kept by any.</hi> Nor did ever any man say so, or can without the greatest Blasphemy against God. But the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is, what Power there is in Man to keep those Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of God; which certainly the Texts insisted on by M. B. doe not in the least give an Answer unto.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="652" facs="tcp:115372:360"/>2. He tels us not, in <hi>what state or condition</hi> he supposes that <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 3.</note> to be, concerning whom the inquiry is made, whether he can <hi>possibly keep the Commandements of God or no:</hi> Whether he speaks of <hi>all men</hi> in generall, or <hi>any</hi> man <hi>indefinitely,</hi> or <hi>restrainedly</hi> of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Nor,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth he informe us, what he intends by <hi>keeping</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God? Whether an <hi>exact, perfect,</hi> and every way <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi> keeping of them, up to the highest <hi>degree</hi> of all things, in all things, Circumstances and Concernements of them: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the keeping of them in an <hi>universall sincerity,</hi> accepted before God, according to the tenure of the Covenant of Grace, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. Nor,</p>
               <p n="4">4. What <hi>Commandements</hi> they are, which he chiefely respects, and under what Consideration: Whether all the Commands of the <hi>Law</hi> of God as such; or whether the Gospell commands of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> which the places from whence he answers do respect. Nor,</p>
               <p n="5">5. What he means by the <hi>impossibility</hi> of keeping Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which he intends to deny; that which is <hi>absolutely</hi> so from the nature of the thing its selfe, or that which is so only in <hi>some respect,</hi> with reference to some certain <hi>state</hi> and Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Man.</p>
               <p>When we know in <hi>what sence</hi> the <hi>Question</hi> is proposed, we <note place="margin">§. 4.</note> shall be enabled to returne an Answer thereunto, which he that hath proposed it here, knew not how to doe: In the mean time, to the thing <hi>its selfe</hi> intended, according to the <hi>light</hi> of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised Distinctions, we say that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Commandements</hi> of God, the whole Law is <hi>excellent, pretious,</hi> not <hi>grievous</hi> in its selfe, or its <hi>own Nature,</hi> but admirably expressing the Goodnesse, and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Holinesse of him that gave it, in Relation to <hi>them</hi> to whom it was given, and can by no means be said, as from it's selfe and upon its own account, to be <hi>impossible</hi> to be kept. Yet,</p>
               <p n="2">2. No unregenerate man can possibly keep, that is, hath in himselfe a Power to <hi>keep</hi> any one of all the Commandements of God, as to the <hi>matter</hi> required, and the <hi>manner</hi> wherein it is required. This impossibility is not in the least relating to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Law, but to the <hi>impotency,</hi> and corruption of the Person lying under it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. No man <hi>though regenerate,</hi> can fulfill the Law of God Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly,
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:115372:360"/> or <hi>keep all the Commandements</hi> of God, according to the Originall <hi>tenour</hi> of the Law, in all the Parts and Degrees of it; nor ever any man <hi>did so,</hi> since sinne entred into the World; for it is impossible that any <hi>regenerate</hi> man should keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, as they are the <hi>tenour</hi> of the Covenant of works. If this were otherwise, the Law would not have been made <hi>weake by sinne,</hi> that it should not justify.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That it is impossible, that any man though <hi>regenerate,</hi> should by his <hi>own strength</hi> fulfill any <hi>one</hi> of the commands of God, seeing without <hi>Christ we can do nothing,</hi> and it is God who works in us <hi>to will and to doe of his good pleasure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. That to keep the Commandements of God, not as the <hi>tenour of the Covenant of Works,</hi> nor in an absolute perfection of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and correspondency to the Law; but <hi>sincerely</hi> and <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly,</hi> unto Acceptation, according to the <hi>tenour of the Covenant of Grace,</hi> and the obedience it requires, through the assistance of the Spirit, and Grace of God, is not only a thing <hi>possible,</hi> but <hi>ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy, Pleasant,</hi> and <hi>Delightfull.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we say,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That a person <hi>Regenerate</hi> by the Assistance of the Spirit and grace of God, may <hi>keep the Commandements</hi> of God, in yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">§. 5.</note> to him, in answer to them, that <hi>sincere obedience,</hi> which in Jesus Christ, according to the tenor of the Covenant of Grace, Is required: yea it is to <hi>him</hi> an Easy and Pleasant thing so to doe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That an <hi>unregenerate</hi> Person should keep any one of Gods Commandements as he ought, is <hi>impossible,</hi> not from the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Gods Commands, but from his <hi>own state</hi> and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That a Person, though Regenerate, yet being so but in <hi>part,</hi> and carrying about him a <hi>body of Death,</hi> should keep the <hi>Commands of God,</hi> in a perfection of Obedience, according to the Law of the Covenant of Works, is impossible from the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Regenerate man, and not from the <hi>Nature of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi> What is it now that M. B. opposes? Or what is that he Asserts?</p>
               <p>I suppose he declares his mind in his <hi>Lesser Catechisme,</hi> Chap. <note place="margin">§. 6.</note> 7. Q. 1. where he proposes his question in the words of the <hi>Ruler</hi> amongst the Jews; <hi>What good shall a man doe that he may have
<pb n="654" facs="tcp:115372:361"/> eternall life?</hi> An Answer of it followes in that of our Saviour, <hi>Math. 19. 17, 18, 19. If thou wilt enter into Life, keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The intendment of this <hi>inquiry</hi> must be the same with <hi>his</hi> that made it, as his Argument in the whole is; or the Answer of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> is no way suited thereunto: Now it is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Inquiry was made according to the principles of the <hi>Pharifees,</hi> who expected Justification by the Works of the Law, according to the <hi>tenour</hi> of a Covenant of Works, to which <hi>presumption</hi> of theirs, our Saviour <hi>suits</hi> his Answer: and seeing they sought to be <hi>justified,</hi> and Saved as it were, <hi>by the Works of the Law,</hi> to the <hi>Law</hi> he sends them. This then being M B's sence, wherein he affirmes that it is <hi>possible</hi> to keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so as <hi>for doing good,</hi> and keeping them, to <hi>enter</hi> into life, I shall only remit him, as our Saviour did the <hi>Pharisees</hi> to the <hi>Law:</hi> but yet I shall withall pray, that our mercifull Lord, would not leave him to the <hi>foolish choyce</hi> of his own <hi>darkned heart,</hi> but in his due time, by the <hi>blood of the Covenant,</hi> which yet he <hi>seems</hi> to despise, send him forth of the <hi>Prison wherein is no water.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 2. <hi>But though it be possible, to keep the Commandements, yet is it</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 7.</note>
                  <hi>not enough, if we desire and endeavour to keep them; although we actually keep them not? And doth not God accept the Will for the Deed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 19. Math. 7, 21, 24, 26. Jam. 1. 25. Rom. 2. 10. Joh. 13. 17. Luk. 11. 24. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Mat. 16. 27. Revel. 22. 21. Mat. 19. 18, 19. In all which places, there is mention of <hi>doing the will of God, of keeping the Commandements of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The aime of this Question, is to take advantage at what hath been delivered by some, not as an ordinary <hi>Rule</hi> for all men to walke by, but as an extraordinary <hi>relief</hi> for some in distresse. When <hi>poore soules</hi> bowed down under the sence of their owne weaknesse, and insufficiency for obedience, and the <hi>exceeding unsuitablenesse</hi> of their best performances to the <hi>spirituall</hi> and exact perfection of the Law of God, (things which the proud <hi>Pharisees</hi> of the world are unacquainted withal) to support them under their <hi>distresse,</hi> they have been by some directed to the consideration of the <hi>sincerity</hi> that was in their <hi>Obedience,</hi> which they did yeild, and guided to examine that, by their desires and endeavours. Now as this direction is not without a good foundation in the Scripture, <hi>Nehemiah</hi> describing the <hi>Saints</hi> of
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:115372:361"/> God by this <hi>character,</hi> that they <hi>desire to feare the name of God, Neh.</hi> 1. 11. and <hi>David</hi> every where professing this, as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent property of a Child of God, so they who gave it, were very farre from understanding such <hi>desires,</hi> as may be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as a <hi>colour</hi> for floath, and negligence, to give countenance to the soules and consciences of men in a willing <hi>neglect</hi> of the performance of such dutyes, as they are to presse after; but such they intend, as had adjoyned to them, and accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying of them, earnest continuall sincere <hi>endeavours</hi> (as M. B. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth) to walke before God in all well pleasing, though they could not attaine to that perfection of obedience that is required. And in this case, though we make not apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the particular Rule of accepting <hi>the will for the deed,</hi> to the generall <hi>case,</hi> yet we feare not to say, that this is all the <hi>perfection,</hi> which the best of the Saints of God in this life at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to, and which according to the <hi>tenour of that Covenant</hi> wherein we now walk with God in Jesus Christ, is accepted. This is all the doing or keeping of the Commandements that is intended in any of the places quoted by M. B. unlesse that last: wherein our Saviour sends that proud <hi>Pharisee,</hi> according to his own principles to the Righteousnesse of the Law which he followed after, but could not attaine. But of this more afterwards. He farther argues,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Though it be not only possible but also necessary to keep the Commandements,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 8.</note>
                  <hi>yet is it lawfull so to do that we may have a right to eternall Life, and the heavenly inheritance? May we seeke for honour, and glory, and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by well doing? is it the tenour of the Gospell that we should live upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in expectation of the hope hereafter? and finally ought weto suffer for the Kingdome of God, and not as some are pleased to mince that matter from the kingdome of God? where are the testimonies of Scripture to this purpose?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. In what sence it is <hi>possible</hi> to keep the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in what <hi>not,</hi> hath been declared. 2. How it is <hi>necessary</hi> or in what sence, or for what end, M. B. hath not yet spoken, though he supposeth he hath; but we will take it for granted that it is necessary for us so to do; in that sence, and for that End and purpose, for which it is of us required. 3. To allow then the Gentleman the advantage of his Captious proceedure
<pb n="656" facs="tcp:115372:362"/> by a multiplication of <hi>entangled queries;</hi> and to take them in that order wherein they lye.</p>
               <p>To the first, <hi>whether we may keep the commandements that we may have right to eternall life.</hi> I say 1. keeping of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the sence acknowledged may be looked on in respect of Eternall life, either as the cause procuring it, or as the meanes conducing to it. 2. A right to eternall life may be considered in respectof the Rise and Constitution of it, or of the <hi>present</hi> evidence &amp; last enjoyment of it. There is a twofold Right to the Kingdome of Heaven; a Right of <hi>desert</hi> according to the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenant of works; &amp; a right of <hi>promise</hi> according to the tenour of the <hi>Covenant of Grace.</hi> I say then, that it is not <hi>lawfull,</hi> that is, it is not the way, Rule, &amp; Tenour of the Gospell, that we should do or keep the commandements, so that that doing or keeping should be the cause <hi>procuring</hi> &amp; <hi>obtaining</hi> an <hi>original</hi> Right, as to the rise and constitution of it, or a Right of desert to eternall Life. This is the perfect tenour of the Covenant of <hi>works</hi> and Righteousnesse of the Law; <hi>do this and live;</hi> if a man do the <hi>worke of the Law he shall live thereby;</hi> and if thou will <hi>enter into life, keep the Commandements;</hi> which if there be any Gospell or new Covenant confirmed in the blood of Christ, is antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to its efficacy, and was ever since the entrance of sinne into the world, as being ineffectuall for the bringing of any soule unto God, <hi>Rom. 8. 3. Heb.</hi> 8. 11, 12. This if it were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, I might confirme with <hi>innumerable</hi> Texts of Scripture, and the transcription of a good part of the <hi>Epistles</hi> of <hi>Paul</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. 3. The inheritance which is purchased for us by Christ, &amp; is the Gift of God, plainely excludes all such confidence in keeping the Commandements, as is pleaded for. For my part, I willingly ascribe to obedience any thing that hath a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistency (in reference to eternall life) with the full purchase of Christ, and the <hi>free donation</hi> of God; and therefore I say 4. as a meanes apointed of God, as the <hi>way</hi> wherein we ought to walk, for the coming to, &amp; obtaining of the <hi>Inheritance</hi> so fully purchased and freely given, for the evidencing of the right gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us thereto by the blood of Christ, &amp; <hi>giving</hi> actuall admission to the enjoyment of the purchase, and to testify our free accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with God, and Adoption on that account, so we ought to do, and <hi>keep the Comandements,</hi> that is, <hi>walke in holinesse,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:115372:362"/> which none shall see God. This is all that is intended, <hi>Re.</hi> 22. 14. Christ speaks not there to Unbelievers, shewing what they must do to be justifyed &amp; saved; but to <hi>redeemed, justifyed,</hi> &amp; <hi>sanctifyed ons,</hi> shewing them their way of <hi>admission</hi> &amp; the meanes of it to the remaining priviledges of the <hi>purchase</hi> made by his <hi>blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His next question is, <hi>May we seeke for honour and glory and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallity</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 9.</note>
                  <hi>by well-doing?</hi> which words are taken from <hi>Rom. 2. 7, 8.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer, the words there are used in a law sence, and are declarative of the Righteousnes of God, in rewarding the <hi>keepers</hi> of the Law of nature, or the Morall Law, according to the Law of the Covenant of Workes. This is evident from the whole designe of the Apostle in that place, which is to convince all men, <hi>Jewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of sinne, against the Law; and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility of the obtainig the Glory of God thereby. So in particular from <hi>v.</hi> 10. where Salvation is annexed to <hi>works,</hi> in the very termes wherein the Righteousnesse of the Law is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed by M. B in the Chapter of <hi>Justification;</hi> and in direct opposition whereunto, the Apostle sets up the Righteousnesse of the Gospell <hi>Chap. 1. 17. Chap.</hi> 3. &amp; 4. But yet translate the words into a <hi>Gospel sence,</hi> consider well doing as the way ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for us to walke in, for the obtaining of the end menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and consider <hi>Glory, Honour,</hi> and <hi>immortallity,</hi> as a reward of our obedience, purchased by Christ, and <hi>freely</hi> promised of God on that account, and I say we may, we ought <hi>by patient continuing in well doing, seeke for glory honour and immortality;</hi> that is, it is our duty to abide in the way, and use of the meanes prescribed, for the obtaining of the <hi>inheritance</hi> purchased and promised: but yet this, with the <hi>limitations</hi> before in part mentioned. As 1. that of our selves we can do no good; 2. that the ability we have to do good, is purchased for us by Christ. 3. This is not so full in this life, as that we can perfectly, to all degrees of perfection, do good, or yeild obedience to the law. 4. That which by grace we do yeild and performe, is not the <hi>cause pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing</hi> or meriting of that inheritance: which 5. as the grace whereby we obey, is fully purchased for us by Christ, and freely bestowed upon us by God.</p>
               <p>His next is, <hi>Is it the tenour of the Gospell that we should live uprightly in expectation of the hope hereafter?</hi> doubtlesse; neither shall I need to give any answer at all to this part of the inquiry but what
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:115372:363"/> in the words of the Scripture, produced for the proofe of our <hi>Catechists</hi> intention. <hi>The Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying ungodlinesse and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and Godly in this present world; looking for the blessed hope and a glorious appearance of the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12, 13. Christ the <hi>great God our Saviour,</hi> having promised an <hi>inheritance</hi> to us with himselfe, at his glorious appearance, raiseth up our hearts with an <hi>hope and Expectation</hi> thereof; his Grace or the Doctrine of it, teacheth us to performe all manner of holinesse, and righteousnesse all our dayes; and this is the tenour and law of the Gospell, that so we do; but what this is to M. <hi>Biddles</hi> purpose I know not.</p>
               <p>His last attempt is upon the exposition of some (I know not <note place="margin">§. 11.</note> whom) who have minced the doctrine <hi>so small</hi> (it seemes) that he can find no relish in it; saith he, <hi>finally ought we to suffer for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, or from the Kingdome of God?</hi> his answer is 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>That you may be counted worthy of the Kingdome of God, for which you also suffer.</hi> I confesse <hi>suffering from the kingdome of God,</hi> is something an uncouth expression; and those who have used it to the Offence of this <hi>Gentleman,</hi> might have more <hi>commodiously</hi> delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red what they did intend. But the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of God being sometimes taken for that rule of Grace which Christ hath in the hearts of Believers, and thereupon being said to be within us, and the word, <hi>from,</hi> denoting the <hi>principle of obedience</hi> in suffering, there is a truth in the expression, and that very consistent with <hi>suffering for the Kingdome</hi> of God, which here is opposed unto it. To suffer <hi>from the kingdome of God,</hi> is no more, then to be <hi>enabled</hi> to suffer from a <hi>principle of grace</hi> within us, by which Christ beares rule in our hearts; and in this sense we say that no man can do or suffer any thing so, as it shall be acceptable unto God, but it must be from the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of God: for they that are in the <hi>flesh</hi> cannot please God, even their <hi>Sacrifices</hi> are an <hi>abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to him. This is so farre from hindring us, as to suffering for the Kingdome of God, that is, to endure persecution for the profession of the Gospell, (<hi>for</hi> in the place of the Apostle cited denotes the procuring occasion, not finall cause) that without it so we cannot do: and so the minced matter hath I hope a savory relish recovered unto it againe.</p>
               <p>His next questions are. 1. <hi>Have you any examples of keeping the</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 12.</note>

                  <hi>Commandements under the Law? what saith David of himselfe?</hi> Psal. 18. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. And</p>

                     </gap>mmandements;</hi> we know full well what <hi>David</hi> saith of his <hi>Obedience;</hi> and what he said of his sinnes; so that we know his <hi>keeping of the Commandements</hi> was in respect of <hi>sincerity,</hi> as to <hi>all</hi> the Commandements of God, and all the parts of them: but not as to his perfection in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all or any of them. And he who says <hi>we keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> says also, that if we <hi>say we have no sinne, we lye, and deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He addes, <hi>Have you not examples of the Choysest Saints who obeyed</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>To obey in hope of Eternall Life,</hi> is either to yeeld obedience, in hope of obtaining Eternall life, as a reward <hi>procured by,</hi> or <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned</hi> to that <hi>obedience;</hi> and so no Saint of God since the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> did yeeld obedience to God, or <hi>ought</hi> to have so done: or to <hi>obey in hope of Eternall life,</hi> is to carry along with us, in our Obedience, an <hi>hope</hi> of the enjoyment of the <hi>promised inheritance</hi> in due time, and to be <hi>encouraged,</hi> and strengthened in Obeying thereby. Thus the Saints of God walke with God, in hope, &amp; Obedience at this day; and they alwayes did so from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning: They have hope in, and with their Obedience, of that whereunto their obedience leads, which was Purchased for them by Christ.</p>

                  <hi>the Scripture, how cometh it to passe that</hi> Paul <hi>saith, We are justified by Faith without Works? meant he to exclude all Good works whatsoever, or only those of the Law?

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> How, and in what sence <hi>workes are necessary to Salvation,</hi> hath been declared, and therefore I remit the Reader to its proper place.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A full Handling of the Doctrine of <hi>Justification,</hi> was <hi>waved</hi> before, and therefore I shall not here take it up, but content my selfe with a <hi>briefe</hi> removall of M. B's attempts to deface it. I say then,</p>
               <p n="3">3. That <hi>Paul</hi> is very troublesome to all the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of this Age, who therefore turne themselves a thousand ways to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Authority of the Word and Truth of God, (by him fully declared and vindicated against their fore-fathers) la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to fortify themselves with distinctions, which as they suppose (but falsely) their Predecessors were ignorant of; <hi>Paul</hi> then, this <hi>Paul,</hi> denyes all <hi>works,</hi> all <hi>works</hi> whatsoever, to
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:115372:365"/> have any share in our <hi>Justification</hi> before God, as the <hi>matter</hi> of our Righteousnesse, or the Cause of our justification. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He excludes all <hi>Works of the Law,</hi> as is confessed. The<note place="margin">§. 21.</note> works of the Law, are the works, that the Law requires. Now there is <hi>no work</hi> whatever that is good or acceptable to God, but it is required by the Law; so that in excluding <hi>works of the Law,</hi> he excludes all Works whatever.</p>
               <p n="2">2 He expresly excludes all Works done by vertue of <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>after Calling;</hi> which (if any) should be exempted from being <hi>works of the Law:</hi> For though the <hi>Law</hi> requires them, yet they are not done from a <hi>principle,</hi> nor to <hi>an end</hi> of the Law; these <hi>Paul</hi> excludes expresly, <hi>Ephes. 8. 9. 10. By Grace we are Saved, not of Workes;</hi> what Workes? those which <hi>we are created unto in Christ Jesus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. All Works, that are Works, are Excluded expresly, and set in an opposition to <hi>Grace</hi> in this businesse, <hi>Rom. 1. 5, 6. If it be of Grace, it is no more of Works, otherwise grace is no more grace; but if it be of Works, it is no more Grace, otherwise Works is no more Works▪</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 3, 4, 5.</p>
               <p n="4">4.

Now this is not Peculiar to any one sort of Works, or to any one Work, more then to another, as might be demonstrated; but this is not a place for so great a Work, as the thorow hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of this Doctrine requires.

                  <hi>from justification, only the perfect Works of the Law, which leave no place for either Grace or Faith, and not such Works as include both, and that by a justifying Faith he meant a working Faith, and such an one as is accompanied with Righteousnesse?</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> Still <hi>Paul</hi> and his Doctrine trouble he man, as they did his Predecessors. That <hi>Paul</hi> excluded all Works of what sort soever, from our justification, as precedaneous causes or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions thereof, was before Declared. M. <hi>B.</hi> would only have it, that the <hi>perfect Works of the Law</hi> only are excluded, when if any Works take place in our justification with God, those only may
<pb n="663" facs="tcp:115372:365"/> be admitted; for certainly, if we are Justified, or pronounced Righteous for our Works, it must be for the Works that are Perfect, or else the judgement of God is not according to Truth. Those only it seems are excluded, that only may be accepted; and imperfect workes are Substituted, as the matter of a perfect Righteousnesse; without which, none shall stand in the presence of God. But,</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is not one Text of Scripture mentioned by M. <hi>B.</hi> whence he aimes to evince his Intention, but expresly denyes what he asserts; and sets all Works whatever in opposition to Grace, and excludes them <hi>all,</hi> from any place in our justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before God: So that the man seems to have been <hi>infatuated</hi> by his <hi>Pharasaisme,</hi> to give direction for his own condemnation. Let the places be considered by the Reader.</p>

               <head type="sub">Of Prayer. And whether Christ prescribed a forme of prayer to be used by Believers: and of praying unto him, and in his name under the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</head>
               <p>THE first Question is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Is Prayer a Christian duty?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Pray without ceasing,</hi> 1 Thess. 5. 17.</p>
               <p>If by a Christian duty, a duty whereunto all Christians are obliged is understood, we grant it a <hi>Christian duty.</hi> The <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands</hi> for it, encouragements to it, Promises concerning it, are innumerable; and the use and benefit of it, in our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, considering the state and condition of <hi>sinne, Emptinesse, Want, Temptation,</hi> Tryalls that here we live in, inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable. If by a Christian Duty it be intended that it is required only of them who are Christians, and is instituted by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:115372:367"/> peculiar in <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> it is denyed. Prayer is a <hi>naturall acknowledgement</hi> of God, that every man is everlastingly, and indispensably obliged unto by vertue of the Law of his Creation, though the matter of it be varied according to the severall states and conditions whereunto we fall, or are brought. Every one that lives in dependency on God, and hath his suplys from him, is by vertue of that dependance obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to this duty, as much as he is to <hi>own God</hi> to be his God. He proceeds.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>How ought men to pray?</hi> Ans. <hi>Lifting up holy hands without wrath</hi>

                  <hi>and doubting.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 8.</p>
               <p>The enquiry being made of the <hi>manner of acceptable prayer,</hi> the answer given respecting only <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two Particulars,</hi> is narrow and scanty. The qualification of the person praying, the meanes of accesse to God, the cause of acceptation with him, the ground of our confidence in our supplications, the Efficacy of the Spirit of Grace as promised, are either <hi>all</hi> omitted, or only <hi>tacitely</hi> intimated. But this, and many of the following Questions, with the answers, being in their <hi>connexion</hi> capable of a good and faire interpretation, though all be not expressed that the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives, in Answer to such Questions, &amp; the most materiall requisite of prayer in the Holy Gost be omitted, yet drawing to a <hi>close</hi> I shall not farther insist upon them; having yet that remaining, which requires a more full <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. 11. <hi>Did not Christ prescribe a forme of prayer to his disciples, so that</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 3.</note>
                  <hi>there remaineth no doubt touching the lawfullnesse of using a forme?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A. Luk 11. 1, 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ans.</hi> If Christ prescribed a <hi>forme of prayer</hi> to his disciples, to be used <hi>as a forme</hi> by the repetition of the same words; I confesse it will be out of Question, that it is Lawfull to use a forme: but that it is lawfull not to use a forme, or that a man may use any prayer but a forme, on that supposition, will not be so easily determined. The words of Christ are, <hi>when you pray, say, Our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther &amp;c.</hi> If in this prescription, not the <hi>matter</hi> only, but the <hi>words</hi> also are attended, and that forme of them which followes is prescribed to be used, by vertue of this command of Christ, it will be hard to discover on what ground we may <hi>any otherwise</hi>
                  <pb n="668" facs="tcp:115372:368"/> pray, seing our Saviours command is positive, <hi>when you pray, say, Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which M. B. is to prove is, that <hi>Our Saviour hath prescribed</hi>
                  <note place="margin">§. 4.</note>
                  <hi>the repetition of the same words ensuing,</hi> and when he hath done so, if so he can do, his conclusion must be, that <hi>that forme ought to be used,</hi> not at all that <hi>any else</hi> may. If our Saviour have prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed us <hi>a forme,</hi> how shall any man dare to <hi>prescribe another?</hi> or can any man do it without casting on his <hi>forme</hi> the reproach of <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection</hi> and insufficiency? Our Saviour hath prescribed us a <hi>forme of prayer</hi> to be used as a forme by the repetition of the same words; therefore we may use it, yea we must, is an invincible argument, on supposition of the truth of the proposition. But our Saviour hath prescribed us such a <hi>forme &amp;c.</hi> thererefore we may use another, which he hath not prescribed, hath neither <hi>shew</hi> nor <hi>colour</hi> of Reason in it.<note place="margin">§. 5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But how will M. B. prove that Christ doth not here instruct his Diciples in <hi>what</hi> they ought to pray for, and for <hi>what</hi> they ought in prayer to addresse themselves to God, and <hi>under what</hi> considerations they are to looke on God in their aproaches to him and the like, only, but also that he prescribes <hi>the words</hi> there mentioned by him to be repeated by them in their suplications. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. he bids them say <hi>Our Father &amp;c.</hi> which at large <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. is, <hi>pray after this manner:</hi>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>to this purpose.</hi> I do not think the Prophet prescribes a <hi>forme of words,</hi> to be used by the Church when he sayes, <hi>Take with you words, and turne to the Lord, and say un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, Take away iniquity,</hi> (Hos. 14. 2.) but rather calls them to <hi>fervent supplication</hi> for the pardon of sinne, as God should enable them to deale with him. And though the Apostles never prayd for any thing, but what they were for the substance directed to by this prayer of our Saviour, yet we do not find, that ever they <hi>repeated</hi> the very words here mentioned, or once commanded or prescribed the use of them, to any of the <hi>Saints</hi> in their days, whom they exhorted to pray so fervently and earnestly. Nor in any of the <hi>Rules</hi> and Directions, that are given for our pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, either in reference to our selves, or him, by whom we have accesse to God, is the use of these words at any time in the least <hi>recommended</hi> to us, or recalled to mind, as a matter of duty.<note place="margin">§. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Our Saviour sayes when ye pray, <hi>say, Our Father;</hi> on supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sence contended for, and that a <hi>forme</hi> of words is
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:115372:368"/>
                  <hi>prescribed,</hi> I aske whether we may at any time pray, and <hi>not say</hi> so? seeing he sayes, <hi>when you pray,</hi> say: whether we <hi>may say any thing else,</hi> or use any other words? whether the saying of these <hi>words</hi> be a part of the worship of God? Or whether any <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>Acceptation</hi> be annexed to the saying so? whether the <hi>spirit of grace</hi> and <hi>supplication</hi> be not <hi>promised</hi> to all believers? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be not given them to enable them to pray, both as to <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner?</hi> and if so, whether the Repetition of the words mentioned by them, <hi>who have not the Spirit given them</hi> for the ends before mentioned, be availeable? and whether <hi>prayer by the Spirit</hi> where these words are not repeated, as to the <hi>letters</hi> and <hi>Syllables,</hi> and order wherein they stand, be acceptable to God? whether the prescription of a <hi>forme</hi> of words, and the gift of a <hi>siprit</hi> of prayer be consistent? whether the forme be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed because Believers are not able to pray without it? Or be cause there is a peculiar Holinesse force and <hi>energy</hi> in the letters words and syllables, as they stand in that forme? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to say the first of those be not derogatory to the Glory of God, and <hi>efficacy of the Spirit,</hi> promised and given to Believers, and the second, to <hi>assert</hi> the using of a Charme in the worship of God? whether in that respect <hi>Pater noster</hi> be not as good as <hi>Our Father?</hi> whether innumerable <hi>poore soules</hi> are not deluded &amp; hardned by <hi>Satisfying</hi> their consciences in, and with, the use of this forme never knowing what it is to pray in the <hi>holy Gost?</hi> And whether the Asserting this forme of words to be used, have not confirmed many in their <hi>Atheisticall</hi> blaspheming of the <hi>holy spirit</hi> of God, &amp; his Grace in the prayers of his people? And whether the repetition of those words, after men have been long praying for the things contained in them, as the manner of some is, be not so <hi>remote</hi> from any <hi>pretence</hi> or colour of <hi>warrant</hi> in the Scripture, as that it is in plaine termes <hi>ridiculous?</hi> When M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> or any on his behalfe, hath answered these questions, they may be supplyed with more of the like nature and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>

There is a twofold praying unto God in the name of Christ. One in expresse words▪ cleare and distinct intention of mind, insisting on his Mediation, and our acceptance with God on his account. The other implyed

This was <hi>vertually</hi> prayer to God in the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> or through him. This is evident from the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Covenant wherein they walked with God; in which they were called to look to the seed of the woman, to expect the blessing in the seed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> speaking of the seed as of one and not of many; as also by all their <hi>types</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> wherein they had by Gods institution respect to him, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> by Faith even as we: So that whether we consider the promise, on the account whereof they came to God, which was of Christ, and of blessing in him; or the means whereby they came, which were <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> &amp; <hi>types</hi> of him; or the <hi>confidence</hi> wherein they came, which was of Attonement and forgivenesse of sinne by him, it is evident, that all their <hi>prayers</hi> were made to <hi>God</hi> in the name of Christ, and not any upon any other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.

If they had any promise of him, if any Covenant in him, if any <hi>Types</hi> representing him, if any light of him, if any longing after him, if any benefit by him or fruit of his Mediation, all their Worship of God was in him, and through him.</p>

On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he lets his followers know, that if <hi>rejecting the Eternall Son of God,</hi> and his righteousnesse, they may not go to Heaven, yet as to Hell, or an <hi>Everlasting</hi> abode in Torments, they may be <hi>secure;</hi> there is no such matter provided for <hi>them,</hi> nor <hi>any</hi> else.

                  <hi>Socinus</hi> first broached this <hi>Abomination,</hi> he did it with
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:115372:371"/> the greatest <hi>cunning</hi> and slight that possibly he could use; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to <hi>insinuate</hi> it insensibly into the minds of men; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full well how full of <hi>scandall</hi> the very naming of it would prove: but the mans successe was in most things beyond his own imagination.</p>
               <p>For the proof insinuated; Life, &amp; <hi>Eternall Life</hi> in the Gospell, as<note place="margin">§. 5.</note> they are mentioned as the <hi>end,</hi> &amp; <hi>Reward</hi> of our <hi>Obedieoce,</hi> are not taken meerly <hi>Physically,</hi> nor do expresse only the <hi>abode, duration,</hi> &amp; continuance of our <hi>being,</hi> but our <hi>continuance</hi> in a state &amp; <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>blessednesse</hi> and <hi>Glory.</hi> This is so evident, that there is no one place, where <hi>Life to come,</hi> or <hi>eternall life</hi> are spoken of simply in the whole <hi>new</hi> Testament, but as they are a <hi>Reward,</hi> and a <hi>blessed Condition</hi> to be obtained by Jesus Christ. In this sence we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the wicked and impenitent shall never see Life, nor obtaine <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> that is, they shall never <hi>come to a fruition of God to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;</hi> but that therefore they shall not have a Life or Being, though in torments, is a wild inference. I desire to know of M. B. whether the <hi>evill Angels</hi> shall be consumed or no, and have an utter end? If he say they shall, he gives us one new notion more: If not, I aske him whether they shall have <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life</hi> or no? If he sayes they shall not enjoy eternall Life in the sence mentioned in the Scripture; I shall desire him to consider, that men also may have their <hi>being preserved</hi> and yet not be <hi>partakers of Eternall Life</hi> in that sence wherein it it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
               <p>The <hi>proof</hi> insisted on by M. <hi>Biddle</hi> sayes, that the <hi>wrath of God</hi>

                  <hi>abides upon unbelievers,</hi> even then when they doe not <hi>see life;</hi> now if they <hi>abide not,</hi> how can the wrath of God abide on them? doth God execute his wrath upon that which is not? If they abide under wrath, they do abide. Under wrath doth not diminish from their abiding, but describes its condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Death and Life in Scripture, ever since the giving of the first<note place="margin">§. 7.</note> Law, and the mention made of them therein, as they expresse the condition of man in way of <hi>Reward</hi> or punishment, are not opposed <hi>naturally,</hi> but <hi>morally;</hi> not in respect of their being (if I may so say) and Relation, as one is the <hi>privation</hi> of the other in the way of nature, but in respect of the <hi>state and condition</hi> which is exprest by the one &amp; the other, <hi>viz.</hi> of <hi>Blessednesse,</hi> or misery. So
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:115372:371"/> that as there is an <hi>eternall Life,</hi> which is as it were a <hi>second life,</hi> a <hi>Life of glory</hi> following a life of Grace; so there is an <hi>eternall death,</hi> which is the <hi>second death,</hi> a death of misery following a death of sinne.</p>
               <p>The death that is threatned and which is opposed to life,<note place="margin">§. 8.</note> and <hi>Eternall Life,</hi> doth not any where denote annihilation, but only a <hi>deprivation</hi> and comming short of that blessednesse which is promised with Life, attended with all the evills which come under that name, and are in the first commination; Those who are dead in trespasses and sinnes are not nothing, though they have no life of grace But M. <hi>Biddle</hi> proceeds, and sayth,</p>

There is mention, of a <hi>naturall death</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which though it be a <hi>dissolution</hi> of nature, as to its essenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all parts of body and soule, yet it is an <hi>Annihilation</hi> of neither; For the soule abides, and M. <hi>B.</hi> professes to believe, that the body shall <hi>rise</hi> againe. There is a Spirituall death in sinne also mentioned, which is not a destruction of the dead <hi>Persons</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but a morall condition wherein he is. And why must the last death be the <hi>Annihilation</hi> pretended? As to a comming short of that which is the proper <hi>life</hi> of the soule in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which is called <hi>life</hi> absolutely, and <hi>eternall life,</hi> it is a <hi>death;</hi> And as to any comfortable <hi>attendencies</hi> of a <hi>being</hi> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, it is a death. That it is a <hi>totall deprivation of being,</hi> seeing those under it are to Eternity to abide <hi>under torments,</hi> (as shall be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) there is no colour.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is called <hi>destruction,</hi> and <hi>perdition,</hi> and <hi>everlasting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,</hi>

               <p>A <hi>very few words</hi> will put an issue to this controversy, if our<note place="margin">§. 15.</note> blessed Saviour may be accepted for an Umpire; saith he, Mat. 25 46. <hi>And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternall:</hi> certainely he that shall be everlastingly punished, shall be <hi>everlastingly.</hi> His punishment shall not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, when he is not.

This addes to the former miracle, that men should be <hi>punished</hi> and yet not be; that they shall be <hi>punished by the stings of a worme</hi> to torment them when they are not, and the burning of a fire, when their whole Essence is consumed. So also <hi>Isa.</hi> 66. 24. <hi>their</hi> torments shall be endlesse, and the meanes of their torments continued for ever: but for themselves (it seemes) they shall have an end, as to their being; and so NOTHING shall be punished with an <hi>everlasting worme, and a fire never to be</hi>

That the tendency of the worke it selfe is to <hi>encrease Infidelity</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> in the world, I dare averre. Let this Chapter be an instance, and from the savour that it hath, let a tast be taken of the whole; and its nature be thereby estimated. That the greatest part of them to whom the mind of God, as revealed in Scripture, is in some measure made known, are not won and Prevailed upon by the <hi>Grace, Love</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> proclaymed therein, and tendred through Christ, so as to give up themselves in all holy Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence unto God, I suppose will be granted. That these men are yet so over powred by the <hi>terrour</hi> of the Lord therein disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and the threats of the wrath to come, as not to <hi>dare</hi> to runne out to the utmost, that the desperate thoughts of their <hi>own hearts,</hi> &amp; the Temptations of <hi>Sathan</hi> meeting in conjunction, would carry them out unto, as it hath dayly &amp; manifold expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences to evince it, so the examples of men so awed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, mentioned in the Scripture, do abundantly manifest.

               <p>Ans. <hi>In a certaine place in Heaven, upon a throne, where a man may see from his right hand to his left.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Doth he ever move out of that place?</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>I cannot tell what he doth ordinarily, but he hath formerly come down sometimes upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. What doth he do there in that place?</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Among other things, he conjectures at what men will doe here below.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Doth he then not know what we do?</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>He doth what we have done, but not what we will do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. What frame is he in, upon his knowledge and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture?</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Sometimes he is afraid, sometimes grieved, sometimes joyfull, and sometimes troubled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. What peaee and comfort can I have in committing my selfe to his Providence, if he knowes not what will befall me to morrow?</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>What is that to me, see you to that.</hi>

               <p n="8">8. Is Jesus Christ God?</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>He is dignifyed with the title of God, but he is not God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. Why then was he called the only begotten Sonne of God?</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>Because he was borne of the Virgin Mary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. Was He Christ the Lord then when he was borne?</p>

               </p>
               <p n="11">11. Hath he still in Heaven an humane body?</p>
               <p>Ans. <hi>No, but he is made a Spirit, So that being not God but man, he was made a God, and being made a God, he is a spirit, and not a man.</hi>

            <p>And now let the Christian <hi>Reader</hi> judge, whether I had any <hi>just occasion</hi> for the expressions <hi>above mentioned</hi> or no; if he be resolved that <hi>those</hi> wordes had <hi>better been omitted,</hi> I shall only profess my selfe in a very great readinesse <hi>to passe by</hi> such mistakes in others, but leave my selfe to his censure.</p>
            <p>And with this <hi>touch</hi> by the <hi>way</hi> am I (as farre as I <hi>have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi>) dismissed to the <hi>eighth chapter;</hi> where all that I am concerned in will receive an <hi>equally</hi> speedy dispatch.</p>
            <p>In the entrance of that <hi>Chapter, M. B.</hi> laies downe two <hi>propositions</hi> that he <hi>rejects,</hi> and <hi>another</hi> that he intends to prove.</p>
            <p>Those he rejects were before mentioned, and my concernment in them spoken to.</p>
            <p>That which he proposes unto confirmation, is:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Justification by Faith, so called in the Scripture, is not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or feeling of Justification before given, or a Justification in, and by our own Conscience, or terminated in conscience; but is somewhat that goes before all such Justification as this is, and is indeed a Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation before God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is but <hi>one Expression</hi> in all this Proposition, that I am <hi>concerned</hi> in; which the <hi>Reader</hi> may easily discover to be pluckt into the <hi>thesis</hi> by <hi>head and eares!</hi> &amp; that is, <hi>terminated in conscience.</hi> What it is I intend by that <hi>Expression,</hi> or what <hi>inconsistency</hi> it hath with that <hi>M. B.</hi> asserts in pretēded <hi>oppositiō</hi> unto it, he doth not explain Now I say, that in the <hi>sense,</hi> wherein I affirme that <hi>Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is terminated in conscience,</hi> I may yet also <hi>affirme,</hi> and that <hi>suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably</hi> to the utmost <hi>intention</hi> of mine in that <hi>expression,</hi> that <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Faith is not a knowledge or feeling of Justification before given,</hi> nor a <hi>justification in, or by our own Consciences,</hi> but somewhat that goes <hi>before all such justification</hi> as <hi>this</hi> is, <hi>and is a justification before God;</hi> I am then utterly <hi>unconcerned</hi> in all <hi>M. B'. Arguments</hi> ensuing, but only <hi>those</hi> that <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>evince,</hi> that our <hi>justification before God</hi> is not <hi>terminated</hi> in our Consciences: which when I <hi>can find</hi> them out, I will do my endeavour to <hi>answer</hi> them, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce my <hi>Opinion.</hi> I find indeed in some of his following <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions</hi> the <hi>words</hi> mentioned; but I suppose he thought not <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi> that they were any way <hi>influenced</hi> from his <hi>Premises.</hi> I know he will not aske, what I meane then by <hi>terminated in Conscience;</hi> seeing it would not be <hi>honourable</hi> for him to have answered a <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:115372:387"/> before he understood it. But upon this <hi>Expression</hi> chiefly is it, that I am <hi>enrolled</hi> into the <hi>troope</hi> of <hi>Antinomians.</hi>

            <p>What I meane by <hi>Absolution in heaven,</hi> the Reader if he <hi>please</hi> may see, chap: 12. pag: 75. 76, 77, 78. of that Treatise, whence <hi>M. B. urges</hi> these expressions: It is neither <hi>eternall Absolution,</hi> nor Absolution from Christ's death (if <hi>from</hi> denote a <hi>simulty</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> and not a <hi>connexion</hi> in respect of <hi>causality,</hi> in which sense <hi>M.

            <p>That by asserting this <hi>Absolution in heaven,</hi> and <hi>justification</hi> to differ as <hi>part and whole,</hi> and <hi>justification</hi> to be <hi>terminated in consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> I make longer worke of it, then those, who say it is <hi>simul &amp; semet,</hi> is <hi>said; simul &amp; semel,</hi> referre unto <hi>time,</hi> I expresly affirme as <hi>M. B.</hi> knowes (or ought to have knowne,) that there is in these <hi>things</hi> an <hi>order</hi> of Nature only. At the <hi>same time</hi> wherein God <hi>absolves us in heaven,</hi> (the terme of the <hi>stipulation</hi> for our deliverance being accomplished) by <hi>reckoning Christ</hi> to us, or in making him righteousness to us, He <hi>infuses a principle of life</hi> into <hi>our soules,</hi> whereby <hi>radically,</hi> and <hi>virtually</hi> the whole is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished.</p>
            <p>That <hi>actuall justification</hi> should <hi>containe permanent</hi> and <hi>transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Acts</hi> together, and that it is so by me described, is affirmed by <hi>a failure of M. B's memory.</hi> Having made this <hi>entrance</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse,</hi> adding the judgment of <hi>some,</hi> whom he cals <hi>most learned and judicious</hi> (as he is <hi>perspicax ingeniorum arbiter</hi>) He concludes his first <hi>section</hi> in these words: <hi>so that howsoever some by plausible words would put a better face on it, the sense of all seemes to be the same, that Justification by Faith is the revelation of God in, and by the conscience, that we are formerly justified; and so their justification

B. attempts to prove, that <hi>the Elect are not justified from eternity,</hi> and concludes his discourse: The <hi>words of one that writes this way are these: Here two things may be observed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What we ascribe to the merit of Christ.</hi> viz: <hi>the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the condition, which God required to make way, that the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which he had freely put upon himselfe might be in actuall force: and so much (I leave to himselfe to consider how rightly) doth M.

            <p>
               <hi>And all know, that a condition as such, is no cause, but an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115372:389"/> or</hi> causa sine qua non. <hi>And is not the death of Christ here fairely advanced, and his merits well vindicated? My constant affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is, and still was, that mans workes are not in the least degree truly and properly meritorious, and that they are such meer Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our salvation, (not of our first justification) as that they are no causes of any right we have (no not to a bit of bread, much lesse) to heaven. Do not these men well defend the honour of Christs merits then, if they give no more to them, then I do to mans workes? that is, not to be the meritorious cause so much as of an houres temporall mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; that is, to be properly no merit at all: It seemes to me therefore that they do by their doctrine of eternall justification or pardon, not only destroy justification by Faith, but also all the merits of Christ, and leave nothing for them to do, for the causing of our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or justification before God. Nay, whether this learned man can make Christ's sufferings, and obedience, so much as a bare condition, let them consider that read him affirming, that conditions properly must be uncertaine, and nothing is so to God: therefore there can be no condition with God, therefore Christ's death could be no more.</hi>

               <hi>M.

Something <hi>M.

Something I have spoken in the former <hi>Treatise,</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the <hi>transaction of the compact,</hi> and <hi>Agreement,</hi> that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> about the <hi>salvation</hi> of the Elect. Of their <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>concernement</hi> therein, with the state of his <hi>body,</hi> of those <hi>that were given</hi> him, on that account, God assisting here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>But p. 228. from <hi>words of mine,</hi> which from several <hi>places</hi> of my <hi>Treatise</hi> are put together, he makes sundry <hi>inferences,</hi> and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses to them all two <hi>conclusions</hi> of his own, pag. 229.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This man</hi> (sayes he) <hi>seems to judge, that the name of compleat justification is proper to that in conscience, and not to be given to any before: He seemes also to judge, that justification hath degrees and parts at many 100 or 1000 years distanced one from another; or else ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution at least hath, which we have hitherto taken for the same thing with justification: For he cals that inconscience compleat justification: so sayth he, absolution in heaven and justification differ as part and whole;</hi> so he</p>

            <p>
               <hi>It seemes M. B, Knowes</hi> not what my judgment is, by his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating, that, <hi>it seemes this is his judgment;</hi> he might have <hi>stayed</hi> from his confutation of it, until he had <hi>Known</hi> it: it is not for his <hi>honour</hi> that he hath done otherwise.</p>
            <p>I deny that it is my judgment, that the name of <hi>compleat justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is <hi>proper</hi> to that in <hi>conscience.</hi> Nor doe I know of any <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> or <hi>compleat justification in conscience;</hi> I only sayd <hi>compleat justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is terminated in conscience:</hi> If <hi>M. B. know not</hi> what I mean thereby, let him <hi>stay a little,</hi> and I shall explaine my selfe.</p>
            <p>It is <hi>most false,</hi> that I judge <hi>justification</hi> to have degrees and <hi>parts</hi> at an 100 <hi>or</hi> 1000 <hi>years</hi> distance; unlesse under the <hi>name of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification</hi> you comprise all the <hi>causes</hi> and effects of it, and then it reaches from <hi>everlasting</hi> to <hi>everlasting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Absolution in Heaven</hi> (as I call it) is before our <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> believing in <hi>order</hi> of <hi>time,</hi> I have no where sayd, but only in <hi>order</hi> of <hi>nature;</hi> and <hi>that M. B.</hi> hath not disproved.</p>
            <p>What <hi>M. B.</hi> thinkes of <hi>absolution</hi> and justification to be the <hi>same,</hi> is no rule to us; when he <hi>proves it,</hi> so it is: but to what I, and <hi>others</hi> have sayd, <hi>M. B.</hi> opposes two <hi>conclusions,</hi> pag. 229. whereof the first is.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We did neither <hi>really,</hi> nor in God's <hi>account dye with Christ when he dyed, nor in him satisfie God's justice, nor fulfil the Law.</hi> the second.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Though Christ was given for the Elect more then for others, yet is he no more given to them then to others; before they are borne, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> of these (he saith) (he meanes <hi>the first of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned,</hi> which the <hi>first</hi> of these is set down in opposition unto) is of so great <hi>moment, and is the heart and root of so many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, yea of the whole body of Antinomianisme, that I had rather write as great a volume as this, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What it is that <hi>I intended by dying with Christ, M. Baxter</hi> does not <hi>know,</hi> nor <hi>ghesse</hi> neer the matter. The consideration of <hi>God's giving the Elect</hi> to Christ, of his <hi>Constitution</hi> to be a <hi>common per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi> a Mediatour and surety, of the whole <hi>compact,</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi> between <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son,</hi> of his <hi>Absolution</hi> as a <hi>common Person,</hi> of the <hi>Sealing,</hi> Confirmation, and the Establishment of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of grace by his death, of the <hi>oeconomy</hi> of the Holy Spirit <hi>founded</hi> therein, of the whole <hi>grant</hi> made upon his <hi>Assention,</hi> must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede

               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:115372:392"/> the <hi>full</hi> and clear <hi>interpretation</hi> of that expression. For the <hi>present</hi> it may suffice, <hi>I have not sayd</hi> that we <hi>did satisfie</hi> God's justice in him, or <hi>satisfie</hi> the Law in him, so that we should be (<hi>personally</hi> considered,) the <hi>principles</hi> of the <hi>satisfaction</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; nor that we <hi>so dyed</hi> in him, as to be <hi>justified,</hi> or absolved <hi>actually</hi> upon his <hi>death,</hi> before we are borne; so that I shall not be concerned <hi>at all</hi> if <hi>M. Baxter's thoughts</hi> should <hi>encline</hi> him to write a <hi>Volume</hi> as bigge as this, about his <hi>confession,</hi> which is no small content to me.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>second; that Christ was given to the Elect more then others,</hi> I say not; because I say., that he was <hi>not given,</hi> as a <hi>Mediatour, Price,</hi> and Ransome for any other at <hi>all.</hi> When the <hi>demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> that <hi>Christ dyed for all,</hi> which <hi>M. Baxter</hi> hath somewhile tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of, are <hi>published,</hi> I may perhaps find <hi>cause</hi> (if I see them) to change my <hi>mind:</hi> but as yet I doe not <hi>suppose</hi> that I shall so doe. That he is <hi>given</hi> to <hi>any</hi> before they are <hi>borne,</hi> I have not sayd; though they are <hi>given</hi> to <hi>him</hi> before they are borne, or that he is given to them in <hi>order</hi> of <hi>time</hi> before they doe <hi>believe;</hi> but this I say, that <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>forgivenesse</hi> of sinne is given them <hi>for his sake:</hi> which, when <hi>M. Baxter</hi> disproves, or pretends so to doe, I shall further consider it, as being a matter of importance: with his <hi>strife of words</hi> (if I can chuse) I shall no more <hi>trouble</hi> my selfe.</p>
            <p>This process being made; <hi>Sect. 3. M. Baxter</hi> lays downe the <hi>conclusion</hi> as <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>them before,</hi> which (as <hi>he informes me</hi>) are maintained by <hi>my selfe and others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>No man now living, was justified, pardoned, or absolved actually from the guilt of sinne and obligation to death at the time of Christ's death or undertaking, or from eternity, or at any time before he was borne, or did believe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After I know not how many <hi>Arguments</hi> brought forth to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme</hi> this <hi>position,</hi> my <hi>Argrments</hi> against it are <hi>produced</hi> and <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;</hi> but what the <hi>learned man</hi> meanes <hi>I professe I</hi> know not: Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse <hi>disputandi prurigine abreptus,</hi> he <hi>cares</hi> not <hi>what he sayes,</hi> nor against whom, soe he may <hi>multiply Arguments and Answers,</hi> and put forth <hi>books</hi> one upon another. In that <hi>very book</hi> of mine which he <hi>animadverts</hi> upon, I use sundry of those very <hi>Arguments,</hi> which here he <hi>useth,</hi> to prove the same <hi>Assertion</hi> for the <hi>substance</hi> of it, as <hi>M. Baxter</hi> hath <hi>here</hi> layd down. And this I had <hi>assured</hi> him,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:115372:392"/> as to a <hi>former mistake</hi> of <hi>his.</hi> My words are pag. 33. as for <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical justification,</hi> whereby a sinner is <hi>compleatly justified,</hi> that it should <hi>precede</hi> believing, I have <hi>not only not asserted,</hi> but <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively denied, and disproved by many Arguments: to be now traduced as a Patron of that opinion, and my Reasons for it publickly answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, seemes to me somewhat uncouth.</hi> Further now to <hi>acquit</hi> my selfe from <hi>that,</hi> which nothing but selfefulness, oscitancy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of others can <hi>possibly</hi> administer any <hi>suspicion</hi> of, I shall not turne aside.</p>
            <p>Yea, but I have said, that the <hi>Elect upon the death of Christ, have a right to all the fruit of the death of Christ to be enjoyed in the appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted season:</hi> because this is made the <hi>occasion</hi> of so many outcrys of <hi>Antinomianisme,</hi> and I know not what, I shall direct the Reader to what I have <hi>affirmed</hi> in this case, &amp; leave it with some brief <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations</hi> to his <hi>judgment,</hi> having somewhat <hi>else</hi> to <hi>doe,</hi> then to <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage</hi> my selfe in a <hi>long wordy</hi> contest with <hi>M.

               <hi>right</hi> was not <hi>subjectively</hi> in them: that is, that it was not <hi>actiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> as <hi>I</hi> expressed it; that they <hi>could not plead it;</hi> but it was as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: Yea but then this is <hi>no more</hi> but <hi>non injustum est,</hi> this is <hi>false</hi> as <hi>I</hi> have <hi>shewed.</hi> Many Divines think, that this was the <hi>estate</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>sinners antecedently</hi> to the consideration of the death of Christ, or might have <hi>been</hi> without it, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was not <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just</hi> with God to <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>save them;</hi> By the <hi>death of Christ</hi> there is a <hi>jus</hi> of <hi>another nature</hi> obtained; even <hi>such</hi> as I have described in the <hi>Treatise M.

            <p>This is that I say; Christ hath <hi>purchased all good things</hi> for us: these things are <hi>actually</hi> to be conferred upon us in the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>order</hi> by God's Soveraigne will <hi>determined</hi> and disposed.

Isaiah</hi> in that <hi>prophesy speakes</hi> of things <hi>to come, as past,</hi> v. 5. 6. and of things <hi>past,</hi> and present, as to come; it <hi>reveales,</hi> not <hi>constitutes</hi> a <hi>Covenant.</hi> But he <hi>saith, we use to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the undertaking and accomplishment: Divines use to say, that upon mans fall Christ undertooke satisfaction, but it was in the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of time that he accomplished it; how therefore he accomplished it in the undertaking, I do not well see.</hi> 2. But <hi>that he</hi> did perfectly <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish what he undertooke I easily grant.</hi> But! how you <hi>learned Divines</hi> distinguish I know not: This I know, that such <hi>poore men as my selfe,</hi> do beleive, that as to the <hi>efficacy</hi> of <hi>satisfaction</hi> and <hi>merit,</hi> Christs <hi>undertaking</hi> was attended with no less then his actuall accomplishment of what he undertooke; or we know not how to grant <hi>Salvation</hi> to the <hi>Saints</hi> under the <hi>Old-Testament:</hi> It was concerning their <hi>Efficacy</hi> as to <hi>merit,</hi> not their <hi>distinction</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween themselves that I spake.</p>
            <p>These things being <hi>premised, M. B.</hi> proceeds to answer my <hi>Arguments,</hi> which were <hi>produced</hi> to prove, that upon the <hi>death of Christ,</hi> there was a <hi>right obtained</hi> for the <hi>Elect</hi> to all the <hi>benefits</hi> of his death; this <hi>right residing</hi> in the <hi>justice</hi> of God, or in the <hi>equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> of these things by divine <hi>constitution,</hi> (as I fully declared in the <hi>place</hi> by <hi>M. B.</hi> opposed) upon the <hi>interposing</hi> of some expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the <hi>processe</hi> of my discourse, of the <hi>grant</hi> being made to the <hi>elect,</hi> and mentioning of <hi>their right,</hi> which in what sense they were to be taken, I expresly delared, <hi>M. B.</hi> takes advantage to <hi>ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer</hi> them all with this intendment put upon them, that they aym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prove a <hi>subjective personall right,</hi> which at any time they <hi>may plead;</hi> when the utmost that my words can be extended unto, is, that they have it <hi>ex faedere,</hi> not <hi>realiter;</hi> for the <hi>subject</hi> of it, I <hi>place</hi> elsewhere. Now if <hi>M.

            <p>This being <hi>premis'd,</hi> his Answers to my Arguments may very <hi>briefly</hi> be consider'd.</p>
            <p>My first Argument is. It is <hi>justum, that they should have the fruites of the death of Christ bestowed on them: therefore they have</hi> jus <hi>unto them:</hi> for, jus est quod justum est.</p>
            <p>M. B. denyes the <hi>consequence,</hi> and saies though it be <hi>justum, yet they may not be subjects of this jus;</hi> to this I have <hi>answered,</hi> by shewing what is <hi>jus</hi> in Generall, &amp; <hi>what</hi> is their <hi>jus,</hi> &amp; <hi>where</hi> fixed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He Questions the <hi>Antecedent;</hi> for the confirmation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and its vindication from his <hi>exceptions,</hi> I referre the Reader to what I <hi>had written</hi> of the <hi>Covonant,</hi> between the father and the sonne, some <hi>good while</hi> before I <hi>saw</hi> M. Bax. Animadversions, or that they were publicke.</p>
            <p>My 2d. is, <hi>that which is procur'd for any one thereunto he hath a Right; The thing that is obtained, is granted by him, of whom it is obtained, and that to them, for whom it is obtained.</hi> To this is answered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the <hi>margent; that I should make great changes in England, If I could make all the Lawyers believe this strange doctrine:</hi> but of <hi>what</hi> the <hi>Lawyers believe,</hi> or do not <hi>believe,</hi> M. B. is no <hi>compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent judg,</hi> be it spoken without <hi>disparagment,</hi> for the <hi>Law</hi> is not his <hi>study.</hi> I, who (perhaps) have much <hi>lesse skill then himselfe,</hi> will be bound at any time to give him <hi>twenty cases,</hi> out of the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> and <hi>Canon Law,</hi> to make good <hi>this Assertion;</hi> which if he <hi>knowes not,</hi> that it may be done, he <hi>ought not to speake</hi> with such <hi>confidence</hi> of these things. Nay amongst our owne <hi>lawyers</hi> (whom perhaps he intends) I am sure he may be <hi>informed,</hi> that if a man <hi>intercede</hi> with another to <hi>settle</hi> his <hi>land</hi> by <hi>Conveyance</hi> to a <hi>third</hi> person, giving him that <hi>conveyance</hi> to keep in trust, untill the <hi>time</hi> come, that he should by the <hi>intention</hi> of the <hi>conveyer</hi> enjoy the Land, though he for <hi>whom it is granted,</hi> have not the least <hi>knowledg</hi> of it, yet he hath <hi>such a right</hi> unto the land thereby cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, as cannot be <hi>disanul'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 2. he saies! <hi>that the fruits of the death of Christ, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd for us,</hi> finaliter <hi>not</hi> subjectivè.</p>
            <p>Ans. They are procur'd for us <hi>objectivè,</hi> are granted, <hi>ex ad
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:115372:396"/> aequatione rerum,</hi> and may make us <hi>subjects</hi> of the <hi>right,</hi> though not of the <hi>things themselves,</hi> which it regards; may I say, though I <hi>do not</hi> say it doth. The following similitudes of <hi>my horse, and a King,</hi> have no <hi>correspondency</hi> with this business at all; of the <hi>Right of horses,</hi> there is nothing in the <hi>Law:</hi> in the <hi>latter,</hi> there is <hi>nothing</hi> omitted in the <hi>comparison,</hi> but <hi>merit,</hi> and <hi>purchase,</hi> which is <hi>all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. All the <hi>fruites of the death of Christ are obtained and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd by his merit for them for whom he dyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>M. B. 1. <hi>not all, not the same measure of sanctification for one as for another: not faith for all, for whom he dyed, as for his Elect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He procur'd it for us as the</hi> finis cui, <hi>not</hi> subjects <hi>of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Right.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. The <hi>substance</hi> of the <hi>fruits</hi> of the death of Christ, and the <hi>ultimate end,</hi> belongs to his <hi>purchase:</hi> the <hi>measure</hi> and <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>them</hi> to the fathers <hi>soveraigne</hi> disposall, <hi>ad ornatum universi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is <hi>most false,</hi> that Christ did not purchase <hi>faith for all,</hi> for whom he dyed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What our <hi>Right</hi> is, hath been before delivered; the <hi>finis cui,</hi> &amp; subject of a present Right, are not very accurately opposed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The nature of merit infers an attendant Right:</hi> Rom: 4. 4. M. B. <hi>If this be your debt, you may say, Lord I have merited sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Christ, therefore it is mine of debt; Christ hath of debt the right to pardon you, you have no debt, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. Very good! but I use <hi>no formes of prayer of other mens composing;</hi> who said, it was <hi>our debt?</hi> who saies our right is actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? The whole here intended, is, that Christ meriting <hi>pardon</hi> of sinnes for the <hi>Elect,</hi> it is <hi>just</hi> they should obtaine it in the <hi>appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> season: such another <hi>prayer</hi> as that here mentioned, doth <hi>M. B.</hi> afterwards <hi>compose</hi> in a <hi>suitablenesse</hi> as he <hi>supposes</hi> to my <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples;</hi> but <hi>what</hi> may he not <hi>do,</hi> or <hi>say?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>He for whom a Ransome is paid, hath a right to his liberty by vertue of that payment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>M. B. <hi>All unproved, and by me unbelieved; if you pay a summe to the Turke for a thousand slaves, thereby buying them absolutly into your owne power, I do not believe that they have any more right to freedome, then they had before. If a Prince pay a ransome for some traytors to the King his father, thereby purchasing to himselfe a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion or a propriety over them, so that they are absolutly his, yet I
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:115372:396"/> thinke it gives them no more right then they had before.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ans. I suppose it is not <hi>yet determined,</hi> that this business is to be <hi>regulated absolutly</hi> according to what M. B. <hi>thinkes</hi> or <hi>believes.</hi> For I must needs say, that whether he <hi>believes it</hi> or <hi>no,</hi> I am still of the <hi>same minde</hi> that I was.</p>

In the close of <hi>this discourse</hi> (with the <hi>method</hi> of a new <hi>line) M. Baxter</hi> fals upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the <hi>payment</hi> made by Christ in our steed, or the <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty</hi> that he underwent for us; and <hi>pleads,</hi> that it was not the <hi>idem</hi> that was due to us, but <hi>tantundem.</hi> Although <hi>some</hi> say this <hi>difference is not tantidem,</hi> (as some speake it seemes) yet he is
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:115372:397"/> resolved of the <hi>contrary,</hi> and that this one <hi>Assertion</hi> is the bottome of all <hi>Antionmianisme.</hi> Seing I professe my selfe to be <hi>contrary minded,</hi> I suppose it will be <hi>expected</hi> that I should <hi>consider</hi> what is here to the purpose in hand <hi>insisted</hi> on by <hi>M. B.</hi> What I intend by <hi>paying</hi> the <hi>idem,</hi> or rather <hi>undergoing</hi> the <hi>idem</hi> that we should have done, I have so fully <hi>elsewhere</hi> expressed; that I shall not <hi>stay</hi> the Reader with the repetition of it. But sayes <hi>M. Baxter</hi> this <hi>subvertes the substance of Religion:</hi>
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. Now you shall have the proofes of it, the <hi>idem</hi> (sayth he) is the <hi>perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, or the full punishment of the man himselfe, and in case of personal disobedience, it is personal punishment that the Law requires,</hi> that is, <hi>suplicium ipsius delinquentis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> But: The <hi>idem</hi> that we would <hi>pay,</hi> or <hi>undergoe,</hi> is <hi>perfect</hi> obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> and proportionable <hi>punishment</hi> by the God's <hi>Constitution,</hi> for <hi>disobedience;</hi> This Christ <hi>payed,</hi> and <hi>under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went;</hi> that the <hi>man himselfe</hi> should undergoe it, is the Law <hi>original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;</hi> but the undergoing or doing of it, by another, is the <hi>undergoing</hi> of the <hi>idem,</hi> I think; it is personal punishment that the Law <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally</hi> requires; but he that undergoes the <hi>punishment</hi> (though he be not <hi>personally</hi> disobedient, which the Law <hi>judgeth</hi> to him that was <hi>personally</hi> disobedient, undergoes the <hi>idem</hi> that the <hi>Law requires.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>idem</hi> is <hi>suppliciam delinquenti debitum,</hi> by whoever it be <hi>undergone,</hi> not <hi>supplicium ipsius delinquentis</hi> only.</p>
            <p>He proceeds: <hi>the Law never threatned a surety, nor granteth any liberty of substitution: that was an act of God above the Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christ did not undergoe the</hi> idem. I deny the <hi>consequence.</hi> Nor is the least <hi>shadow</hi> of proof made of it: The question is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christ be <hi>the sinner,</hi> but whether he <hi>underwent</hi> that which was due to the <hi>sinner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He addes. <hi>If therefore the thing due was payd, it was we our selves morally or legally, that suffered:</hi> I know not well what is <hi>meant by morrally;</hi> but <hi>however</hi> I deny the <hi>consequence;</hi> the thing it <hi>selfe was payd</hi> by <hi>another</hi> for us, and the <hi>punishment it selfe</hi> was undergone by another, in our stead.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>followes,</hi> fals with that which went <hi>before,</hi> being built thereon. It <hi>could not be our selves Legally</hi> (saith he) <hi>because it was not our selves naturally.</hi> Though for the security of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> opposed, there is no <hi>need</hi> of it, yet I deny his <hi>proposition,</hi>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:115372:398"/> also, is taken <hi>universally.</hi> A man may be accounted to doe a thing <hi>Legally</hi> by a <hi>sponsor,</hi> though he doe it not in his own Person.</p>
            <p>But he says, <hi>if it had been our selves Legally, the strictest justice could not have denyed us a present deliverance</hi> ipso facto, <hi>being no ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice can demand any more then the</hi> idem quod debitur. (as <hi>M. Baxter's Printer</hi> speakes) But 1: it is <hi>supposed,</hi> that all <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal performance</hi> of any thing, by any one, must be done in his own <hi>Person.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It <hi>supposes,</hi> that there is such an <hi>end</hi> as deliverance assigned, or <hi>assignable,</hi> to the <hi>offenders</hi> own undergoing of the <hi>penalty,</hi> which is false.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Reasons and Righteousness of our actual <hi>deliverance</hi> at the <hi>time,</hi> and in the manner prescribed by <hi>God,</hi> and (as to the <hi>last</hi>) revealed in the <hi>Gospel,</hi> upon Christ's performance of <hi>personal</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and <hi>undergoing</hi> the <hi>penalty</hi> due to us in our <hi>stead;</hi> which are founded in the <hi>oeconomy of the Trinity,</hi> voluntarily inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into for the <hi>accomplishing</hi> the salvation of the <hi>Elect,</hi> I have elsewhere touched on, and may, if I <hi>find</hi> it necessary, hereafter handle at large.</p>
            <p>That which is feared in this business is, that if the <hi>idem</hi> be payd, then according to the <hi>Law,</hi> the <hi>Obligation</hi> is <hi>dissolved,</hi> and present deliverance followes. But if by the <hi>Law,</hi> be meant the <hi>Civil Law,</hi> whence these termes are <hi>borrowed,</hi> it is most certain, that <hi>any thing</hi> in <hi>stead</hi> of that which is in the Obligation doth according to the <hi>Rules</hi> of the Law dissolve the <hi>Obligation,</hi> and that whether it be payd by the <hi>principal debtour,</hi> or Delinquent, or <hi>any</hi> for him; The beginning of that <hi>Section,</hi> quibus modis tollitur obligatio, <hi>lib. 3. Instit:</hi> will evince this sufficiently. The <hi>Title</hi> of the <hi>Section</hi> is, Si solvitur ID quod debetur, vel ALIUD loco illius, consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiente creditore, <hi>omnis solvitur Obligatio,</hi> tum <hi>rei</hi> principalis, quam fide-jussoris. The words of the <hi>Law</hi> it selfe are more full. Tollitur autem omnis obligatio solutione EJUS quod debetur; vel siquis consentiente creditore ALIUD pro ALIO solverit; nec inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest <hi>quis</hi> solverit, utrum IPSE qui debet, an ALIUS pro eo: liberatur enim &amp; <hi>alio</hi> solvente, sive sciente, sive ignorante debito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, vel invito, eo solutio siat: Si fide-jussor solverit, non enim ipse <hi>solus</hi> liberatur, sed <hi>reus.</hi> So that there is no difference in the Law, whether <hi>solutio</hi> be <hi>ejusdem</hi> or <hi>tantidem;</hi> and this is the case in the things that are <hi>ex maleficio, aut quasi;</hi> as may be seen at large in the <hi>Commentatours</hi> on that place.</p>

            <p>To caution all <hi>men</hi> against the <hi>poyson</hi> of Antimonian <hi>Doctrines.</hi> now so <hi>strenuously</hi> opposed by <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> and to deliver <hi>students</hi> from the unhappy <hi>model</hi> of <hi>Theologie,</hi> which the men of the <hi>prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding contests</hi> have entangled <hi>themselves,</hi> and <hi>others</hi> withal, <hi>M.

            <p>Now if these two <hi>Distinctions,</hi> as <hi>carefully</hi> heeded, and as <hi>wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> observed as we are <hi>able,</hi> will prove such an <hi>antidote</hi> against the <hi>infection,</hi> for <hi>my part</hi> (in all <hi>probability</hi>) I shall be <hi>secure,</hi> having owned them ever since I learned my <hi>Catechisme,</hi>

            <p>And so am I dismissed.

            <p>If men be in <hi>hast</hi> to <hi>oppose</hi> what I have <hi>delivered</hi> about this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, let them (if they please, I have no Authority to prescribe them <hi>their way</hi>) speak <hi>directly</hi> to the purpose, and oppose that which is <hi>affirmed,</hi> and answer my <hi>reasons</hi> in reference to that <hi>End</hi> only for which by me they are <hi>produced</hi> and insisted on:</p>
            <p>Because I <hi>see</hi> some men have a <hi>desire</hi> to be <hi>dealing</hi> with me, and yet know not <hi>well</hi> what to <hi>fix upon,</hi> that I may deliver them from the vanity of contending with their own <hi>surmizes,</hi> and if it be <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,</hi> to prevaile with them <hi>to speak closely, clearly, and distinctly</hi> to the matter of their <hi>contests,</hi> &amp; not mixe <hi>heterogeneous</hi> things in the <hi>same</hi> discourse, I will briefly <hi>shrive</hi> my selfe for their satisfaction.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:115372:399"/>
            <p>First then I doe not <hi>believe</hi> that any man is <hi>actually justified</hi> from <hi>eternity;</hi> because of that of the Apostle <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 28, 29, 30: but yet what is the <hi>state</hi> of things, in reference to the <hi>oeconomy</hi> of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> engaged in from <hi>Eternity</hi> for the salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>sinners,</hi> with that <hi>fountaine union,</hi> that is between <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>body</hi> in their <hi>predestination,</hi> I shall desire a <hi>little more time</hi> to delivery my selfe unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2 I doe <hi>believe</hi> that there was a <hi>Covenant, compact,</hi> or <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> between father and <hi>Son</hi> for the salvation of the <hi>Elect</hi> by his <hi>mediation,</hi> which, upon <hi>sinnes</hi> entring into the <hi>world,</hi> had an <hi>efficacy</hi> &amp; <hi>effect</hi> of the very same <hi>nature</hi> with that, which it hath when he hath <hi>actually</hi> accomplished what was on his part <hi>required</hi> for the end <hi>proposed</hi> to him; &amp; that <hi>therefore</hi> in <hi>the old Testament</hi> his death is spoken of sometimes as <hi>past, Isa.</hi> 53. 4, 5, 6: &amp; that to make this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> in it's <hi>Constitution</hi> to be contemporary to it's <hi>revelation,</hi> or the <hi>promises</hi> of it to be then made to <hi>Christ,</hi> when the Church is <hi>acquainted</hi> that those <hi>promises</hi> are made, is a wide mistake.</p>
            <p>But under what consideration the <hi>Elect</hi> lye unto God, upon the transaction of this original <hi>Covenant</hi> with the <hi>Mediatour. I</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire <hi>liberty</hi> for a while as above.</p>
            <p n="3">3 I doe not believe that the <hi>Elect,</hi> that live <hi>after</hi> the death of Christ, are all <hi>actually</hi> in their own <hi>Persons justified</hi> and <hi>absolved</hi> at his <hi>death;</hi> because <hi>the wrath of God abides on men that believe not,</hi> Joh. 3. 36. But yet what to the <hi>advantage</hi> of the Church is enwrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the <hi>discharge</hi> of their great <hi>representative,</hi> who dyed in their stead (for that I believe also, and not only for their <hi>good</hi>) I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire respite for my thoughts as <hi>formerly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. I doe <hi>believe</hi> that Christ underwent the <hi>very same punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for us, for the <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>kind</hi> of it, which we were obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto, &amp; should have <hi>undergone,</hi> had not he <hi>undertaken</hi> for us, and payd the <hi>idem</hi> that we should have done, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 12. Gal. 3. 13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I believe that upon the <hi>death of Christ,</hi> considering what hath been sayd before concerning the <hi>compact,</hi> and <hi>Agreement between</hi> God and the <hi>Mediatour,</hi> about that matter; it became <hi>just</hi> and <hi>righteous,</hi> with reference to God's <hi>justice,</hi> as <hi>Supreme Governour</hi> and moderatour of the creatures, and all their <hi>Concernements,</hi> that <hi>those</hi> for whom he <hi>dyed,</hi> should all be made <hi>partakers</hi> of all the <hi>good</hi> things, which Christ by his <hi>death</hi> procured for them, in the <hi>season</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:115372:399"/> appointed by the soveraigne will of <hi>God.</hi> But that this right though <hi>indissoluble</hi> is so <hi>actually</hi> vested in them, as to be <hi>actionable</hi> in the <hi>Gospel</hi> without <hi>faith,</hi> I believe not.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I believe that all <hi>spiritual</hi> blessings, <hi>mercyes, priviledges</hi> whatever, are <hi>fruites</hi> of the <hi>death</hi> of Christ, and that notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the <hi>order</hi> wherein they <hi>stand</hi> one to another, they all depend immediately on it's causality; though <hi>respectu termini</hi> they have not a natural <hi>immediation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>I professe</hi> that we are <hi>absolved, pardoned,</hi> and <hi>justified</hi> for Christ's sake, &amp; therefore that Christ is <hi>reckoned</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> or <hi>made righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> in order of nature <hi>antecedently</hi> to all those things, which for his sake we doe receive, and are made <hi>partakers of</hi> with and by him, &amp;c.</p>
